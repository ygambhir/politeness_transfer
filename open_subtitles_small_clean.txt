my sassy girl
exactly two years ago today, she and i buried a time capsule here.
we promised to meet here two years later, but she hasn't come yet.
i'm going to wait.
here we go.
please, don't move.
one, two
wait a minute.
oh, auntie.
sorry, i'm on my way.
i'm really sorry.
yes, i'm coming.
i'm having my photo taken.
are you ready?
here we go.
one, two
my parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
so i thought i was a girl until i was seven.
i had to go to the women's public bath, too.
the older i got,
but it was the opposite.
first half
he hasn't changed at all.
no, i'm a real man now.
think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
you irritate me!
my job was tougher than you could imagine.
i worked near the dmz.
who are you kidding?
hold it.
anyway, welcome back home.
she's just my type.
when i see my type, i can't help it.
i need to hit on her.
who's interrupting me?
who is this?
 oh, mom
why aren't you at your aunt's house?
i'm leaving soon.
keep quiet!
it's my mom!
talk over there!
make sure you pay a visit.
it's been over a year since you saw her.
that long?
you know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
she says you resemble him.
she'll be so glad to see you.
still there?
we don't look alike.
plus, i hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
uncle does, too.
she'll introduce you to a girl.
i know the type she likes.
tell her no thanks.
i want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
but on that day
she's my type, but i don't like her.
drunk girls disgust me.
hey, get up!
offer your seat to the elderly!
don't wear pink.
she call him honey!
i'm not
what are you doing!
i'm not
you handle this!
i'm not
think i'm stupid?
come here!
are you laughing?
why didn't you look after her?
hurry and do something!
what are you doing?
i'm sorry.
let me help with cleaning expenses.
forget it.
just take care of her.
nothing's there when you need it.
where did all those motels go?
i hate being with a drunk girl.
carrying her on my back is worse.
wow, your honey's wasted.
no, it's not my fault.
of course, it is.
i know everything.
you see, we're engaged.
western or korean style?
give me any room.
room 405.
none on the first floor?
fourth floor!
you forgot to check in.
it's 40,000 won, kid.
40,000 won?
find another place then.
count it.

shindangdong, joonggu
hey, why do you keep reading this?
016 228 53
oh, please
a thousand won left!
this phone's owner?
she's sleeping beside me.
the uksu motel near bupyung station.
better wash and leave fast.
hands in the air!
what are you doing?
hands in the air!
no, i'm not, sir!
i told you.
i'm an innocent victim.
talk about it later and get in there.
i'm gonna die mad!
come over here.
come on!
please, forgive me just this once.
please, forgive me.
i can't get in there
how are you?
please, please, save my life!
how are you?
please, just for once!

what's your name?
answer now!
boss told you!
gyeonwoo, i'm gyeonwoo.
what brought you here?
i'm innocent.
i'm telling the truth, sir!
no, i don't mean that!
i'm gonna put it right.
i'm sorry.
you raped a girl, huh?
come on!
shoot now, you little creep!
you wanna cut your finger or talk now?
you turn against him, or what?
all of you.
eat one a piece, okay?
yes, boss.
what are you looking at?
look away.
you're out!
take care you guys!
and remember to keep in touch!
oh, yeah.
don't just pass by us next time, all right?
of course.
see you.
you come over here.
didn't i say eat one a piece!
i'm home.
did you go to bupyung?
yes, i did.
come here!
where did you sleep?
your aunt said you didn't come!
and you're telling me a lie!
what happened to your sweater?
i'm such a poor guy.
all this because of a drunk girl.
i wanna die.
you asked if i went to bupyung!
i did, but not to see auntie!
wait till he comes back.
know me now, right?
i'm a typical student.
an engineering major.
i'm smart, but i never study.
my parents can prove that.
you're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
up four points in three years.
call this a report card?
since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
if you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
they'll never study.
my goals?
haven't thought about it yet.
you know now?
you got it.
i'm a hopeless student.
who's calling?
why were you naked in a motel with me?
come out!
to bupyung station now!
how could she do this?
i went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
excuse me.
is it you?
follow me.
get over here.
what do you wanna eat?
cherry jubilee
mango tango or shooting stars
jamonka almond's good, too.
i'll just have a love me.
hey, wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees.
you pay for it.
tell me.
what happened last night?
well, it's
you were drunk, so
don't stumble, and speak clearly!
you see.
you were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
i saved you from the train.
i thought maybe this girl was a snake.
pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
so i called you honey?
that's right.
i kind of remember that.
you showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
that's right.
would you believe that, too?
to a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
so i did that, right?
yes, you did.
 sorry, it's late.
 yeah
when she's not drunk, she's just my type.
you look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
are you mocking me?
no, i'm not.
then are you hitting on me?
i don't wanna date you.
we're not destined for each other.
throw the trash away.
i think she's a heavy drinker.
you order.
kimchi soup and soju, please.
eat golbangee.
then you should order.
stop pouting!
golbangee, please.
let's go somewhere fun later.
i know what that means.
 a motel?
are you rich?
 of course.
how much will you give us?
we'll see, so don't worry.
you kids are prostituting, huh?
why'd you order golbangee?
eat something else!
what's it to you?
mind your own business.
we're just having a drink with some friends.
what's wrong?
you take friends to a motel?
how old are you kids?
old enough to drink.
mind your own business.
think i'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
show me your id.
you, too.
what's with you?
show it, now.
this sucks.
she's a vicious chick.
no matter how pretty she is,
i'm too embarrassed to be with her.
who are you to butt in other people's business?
 don't you have a daughter?
 i don't.
bear me one.
who the hell do you think you are?
 how dare you?
 come on, let's fight!
come on!
i'll show you.
don't live like that!
catch up with the girls.
have a drink and calm down.
seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
she's more attractive the closer i look at her.
did you blow your nose on this?
please, stop crying.
the handkerchief is mine.
to be honest,
i broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
excuse me.
wake up.
come on, wake up.
your fiances wasted again?
what now?
sign you in like before, right?
but, mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
no, you buy it.
where did you go, honey?
 what!
what is it?
 uh!
i saw her lips.
her white neck.
i saw her breast, too.
while watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
i want to heal her sorrow.
give me some water.
why am i here?
you see.
i'm sorry, but i saw your id, and you're twentyfour.
if you talk down on me again
so what are you gonna do?
just that
give me the towel.
you see, i'm a year older.
 then talk like friends.
 yeah?
in the bathroom.
our relationship is so peculiar.
we met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
that's how our relationship began.
lee hyungchul.
jeun miyoung.
kang mangyu.
is he absent?
no, no!
i'm here!
then answer right away.
gonna be sucks!
lee jeungmin.
gu seolsoo.
yes, i'm here.
how about a break?
you're right.
let's take a break.
let's go.
go where?
class isn't over yet.
don't be a coward.
he called roll, right?
let's go.
i can't.
i can't miss this class.
kill me instead.
all right.
who is she?
she's pretty.
doesn't matter.
a girl needs to act pretty.
 but she's still pretty.
 nice body, too.
who's gyeonwoo?
it's me, sir.
i won't mark you absent so you can leave.
pardon me?
i said leave.
wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
so go see her.
thank you, sir.
oh, gyeonwoo.
if you can, raise it with her.
it worked.
what did you tell him?
that i'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
no, no!
professor, it's not true!
she wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
she called them synopsis.
to get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
reading her synopsis was stressful.
if i miss anything, i'm dead.
wanna die?
finish reading it.
i will.
how could you throw the butt here?
pick it up!
and why did you wear that color?
then what about you?
don't wear the same color as mine!
the heroine is tough, like the "terminator".
the year is 2137.
villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
i don't know why.
to save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
they have to kiss in the end.
this isn't a melodrama.
it's an action movie.
you don't know movies.
koreans like melodramas.
know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
"shower" by hwang sunwon.
it shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
koreans like sad movies all because of "shower".
what's sad about it?
it's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
i couldn't sleep for one week.
the ending sucks.
gotta change it.
it's sad.
her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
their family line is broken up now.
but, you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
this was her last request.
when i die, please, bury me with my loving friend.
to bury him alive, even.
oh, my gosh.
 what's the matter?
 what's wrong?
no way!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!
bury him!
they bury him alive.
isn't it sad?
i must be hurt still.
i think i'll never get over him.
how deep could it be?
i don't know.
gyeonwoo, go in the water.
i wanna know how deep it is.
come on.
help me!
help me!
wow, it's deep.
i can't swim!
yes, it's deep
my mind was getting blurry.
at that moment
heard you got a girlfriend.
introduce me.
 really?
 i'm serious.
is she pretty?
have you kissed her?
gonna introduce me or not?
she's really pretty?
what are you looking at?
see that girl over there?
she's my girlfriend from today.
got it?
excuse me
hey, baby.
 are you free?
 hey?
come here.
how could a coincidence like this happen?
reportedly there is a runaway soldier
you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
let's drink.
drink till we die.
one hour ago it's me.
where are you?
what are you doing?
meeting your friends?
can't i join us, can i?
why not?
i wanna see your friends!
now, you're dead.
excuse me
you've just forgotten your things.
oh, my gosh!
it's kind of you, thanks.
do you want me to hold it for you?
 oh, no.
that's all right.
 all right then.
i'll help you, ma'am.
 oh, thank you.
 no problem.
watch your step!
hey, money!
since i'm drunk,
i decided to take revenge on her.
if i'm out cold at bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
this stop is bupyung station
hey, kid.
wake up.
wake up.
where am i?
i'm at inchon station.
be here in 30 minutes.
wake up.
get up, idiot.
go away, buttbrain.
talking back?
 what the
how're you?
how are you?
oh, how is it going?
go away, buttbrain?
you got a bad mouth.
i'll set you straight the gangster's way.
on your head.
get up.
sit down.
get up.
sit down.
roll right.
roll left.
do it right.
keep going!
what's going on there?
stop fooling around.
you lowlife thieves.
 what officer?
 keep quiet.
lowlife thieves?
 hey.
want some of this?
 no, thanks.
try it.
it's delicious.
 no.
 hey, boy.
pay attention to your elders.
eat it, buttbrain.
i told you no.
how many times did i tell you?
am i your toy?
leave me alone you petty thieves!
stop toying with me, you jerks!
it's humiliating!
good morning.
 keep quiet!
 thank you.
thank you.
do that again, and you're dead.
are you free, baby?
your english is good, too.
better behave!
wanna die?
taste good?
it's so delicious.
you're very happy to see me, aren't you?
be good to me and you'll always be with good luck.
if i sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
if she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
if she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
when i'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
so i have to come at the right time.
you studying now?
yes, i'm.
i'm looking over something on the internet.
 go to bed now.
 you too, dad.
 all right, good night!
 good night.
ok then, i'm gonna have a sleep too.
you're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
of course not, dad.
you don't trust me?
no, i do.
time for bed.
 go to sleep.
 good night, dad.
hi, gyeonwoo.
my birthday's in two days.
you're dead if you forget.
got it?
since i like you so much, better make me smile like this.
got it?
i got it.
her birthday.
if i prepare nothing, she may murder me.
i have a good idea.
before going to the service, i worked in a theme park.
so this is my plan.
at midnight, i'll be alone with her in the park.
it'll be completely dark all around us.
one by one, the lights to the merrygoround flick on.
i raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
then all the lights turn on and it moves.
there's fireworks, too.
isn't it fantastic?
she'll be thrilled.
i gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
 jump over here?
 yeah.
we have to.
i always wanted to come here at night.
it's my birthday, not yours.
please, let's just try.
i'll go up first and help you.
there's a step here.
take my hand.
answer me.
i'm leaving.
i'm leaving.
answer me!
you're dead.
wait till i catch you.
why didn't you answer?
wanna die?
come with me!
hurry and get in.
shut up!
go in fast.
move it.
sit here.
if you're loud, i'll kill you.
got it?
 answer quietly!
 yes.
is that a real gun?
 wanna see?
 forget it.
how are you two related?
we're just friends.
i'm not a cat or anything!
go ahead and apologize!
i'll do it.
i'm sorry.
anyway, friends come here late at night?
why are you here?
we just wanted to come here at night.
 tell me the truth, idiot.
 nothing special.
what makes you trust a guy like him?
i trusted myself.
i had a girlfriend, too.
she visited me every week for one year.
i was so happy.
i found out the fact after he was discharged.
while i'm in the service, even my dog ran away with some mutt, too.
my yorkshire terrier.
i have the worst luck in this world.
know what special day is it today?
this sucks!
hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
don't know.
heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
that's serious.
a teeny bullet does that?
yeah, the bullet tears the
what are you two doing?
stop joking around.
even you bastards ignore me.
 that's why you shouldn't be foolish.
 why?
am i foolish?
even if you do this, she won't come back.
i know.
i know, too.
but if i die, she'll be heartbroken.
she'll never be the same.
you're wrong.
the pain goes away sooner than you think.
you went through something like this?
it happens that way.
if i'm caught, i'll go to the can.
i'll always think of her there.
what does "can" mean?
it means prison.
 don't interrupt.
 sorry.
anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
excuse me, sir.
how about letting her go?
if i say no?
then let me go, instead.
come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
you act like him, too.
you can go.
and you
we die together.
got it?
hey, lady.
got it?
 go!
 let's go together.
all three of us.
will you leave if i kill him?
don't worry too much.
this soldier isn't a bad guy.
you'll come out safely.
you're leaving me alone?
there's no other way.
i was afraid to die alone, but i'm glad we're in it together.
oh, right.
over there, there's an exit near the merrygoround.
nobody knows about it.
i used to work here.
you're not tricking me, right?
i'm a man, too.
why would i?
walk in front of me.
i told you so.
this way!
what's going on?
it's gyeonwoo.
screw you!
don't come closer!
i'll kill him!
i'll really kill him!
so she can see me die!
i'll give you an hour!
if not, i'll kill him, and myself, too!
 got it?
 hurry up!
sniper 2!
the hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
don't shoot!
hey, soldier!
i mean sir!
your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
did you really love her?
ask yourself.
i think you didn't.
if you really love her, you should let her go.
if not, then it's not love.
what's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
stop this, and go back to the base as a real man.
a person like you should learn more about love.
if we want to learn, then we should keep living.
she's the nicest girl i've met.
don't let her go.
got it?
if you do, i'll take her.
 can i go?
 go.
screw it.
don't know.
thank you.
today's my birthday.
i'll live on until i learn what love is.
we're just friends?
no, i said that to save you.
"let me go, instead?"
wanted to save yourself, huh?
he wouldn't have let you go.
stop lying!
stop lying!
stop lying!
have a nice life alone.
i screwed up her birthday, but i feel good anyway.
'cause i'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
i hope you believe in me.
you can't?
second half
i remember.
she always came with him until last year.
was it last spring or winter?
one day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
to not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
what's up?
oh, hi.
you're early.
i was in the neighborhood.
miss me?
of course!
she always tried hard to look cheery.
 i like her that way.
 what would you like?
coke, please.
wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees, please.
i know her.
she pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
what are you doing?
what are you smiling at?
it's nothing.
looks fun, huh?
 another one?
 why?
don't wanna read it?
she may get disappointed, but i should be honest for her sake.
looks fun.
i'll read it.
this time it's a martial arts film.
the heroine is a bounty hunter.
the villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
the worst of his kind.
what happened?
his name's gyeonwoo?
the story's setting is a mess.
japan invades during king sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant yeonsan.
in the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
the heroine becomes a king.
king jungjo.
she's from the future, of course.
it's fun, huh?
why is the heroine always from the future?
science is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.
and people go to the past to travel.
people from the future could be here now.
i think ufos are time machines.
someday, i'll meet someone from the future.
i have to.
if you do, ask him to take you.
if it's possible
give this to shin cine.
tell them to cast han sukgyu and shim eunha.
jeon doyun is okay, too.
excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
well this is "the warrior's sad love story"
it's going to be a hit.
shin cine didn't call back.
hey, kid.
is the subway your sketch book?
don't scribble on it.
wanna die?
my lipstick!
i always take her home, even to bupyung station.
it's something a man must do.
on the way, we play fun games, too.
left foot over the line, i win.
with the right foot, you win.
what's the prize?
let's see
how about a kiss?
a kiss?
wanna die?
you choose.
hitting each other.
you can hit me, too.
someone's coming.
i think this is unfair.
i'm a girl, so i'll slap the cheek.
then i'll change it, too.
 but i'm a girl.
 men and women are equal.
okay, then.
you slap, and i slap, too.
go easy on me, and i'll kill you.
better slap me on the cheek.
if you don't, i'll kill you!
all right.
you slap, and i'll use my finger.
right, that's fair.
saw that?
see that guy step over with his left foot?
i had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
i thought it was this way.
shut up.
here they come.
left foot.
left foot.
it'll be the right foot.
switch to the right.
you have to hit me?
you know why the sky is blue?
'cause the reflection of the sunshine.
it's for me!
i want it to be blue.
so, it's blue.
you know why the fire is hot?
it's all for me.
i want it to be hot.
so it is.
you know why we have four seasons here in korea?
 because of you.
 that's correct!
and why you were born here?
 it's for me as well.
 what?
that's nonsense.
i was born before you.
you know the word "worship"?
"peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of jesus," huh?
yeah, i know.
so, get ready!
come here.
stay still.
when i'm with her,
i never know how the day will turn out.
what are you looking at?
i quit!
is your face a racket?
why does the ball always hit my face?
it's strange.
i never want to lose a game.
so i play until i win.
wait long?
just a teeny bit.
my mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
want a massage?
no, it's okay.
instead, let's exchange shoes.
don't wanna?
how can a guy wear heels?
it'll fit.
but, i can't
i see.
come on.
i'll buy you some sneakers.
forget it.
then wear mine, and i'll carry yours.
you don't understand women.
let's exchange.
wanna know a secret?
what is it?
but i had one today.
catch me, honey!
if you don't, i'll kill you.
 phew
 catch me, honey!
stop right there!
it was just a second, but i felt something in her eyes.
that's my house.
i'll bring you an umbrella.
i'm okay.
i'm already wet so i'll just leave.
are you my daughter's boyfriend?
yes, sir.
how much do you know about my daughter?
not much
next time, don't hang out till late.
you don't understand me.
why'd you stand him up?
what's wrong with him?
why do you stand guys up?
and what happened to your heels?
what's wrong with you?
i told you not to meet gyeonwoo.
he's dumb and has no future.
it's none of your business.
why is he stupid?
you're stupid so you don't know.
what has gotten into you?
let me live my own life!
i didn't hear from her for a long time.
 hello?
 gyeonwoo, it's me.
long time no see.
her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
our 100th day celebration is soon.
it's 100 days already?
when do you think a girl's the prettiest?
when a sexy woman is naked.
where are you now?
stay right there.
no, i'm just kidding.
the prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
what's your favorite song?
that george winston song.
pachelbel canon?
yeah, that song.
you're not gonna ask me?
when is the guy the prettiest?
just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
do it yourself, okay?
what did you say?
how can i during class?
just hung up on me!
i don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
oh, my god!
a burglar!
help, a burglar!
are you crazy?
you're gonna break into where?
what on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
and you
why you didn't drop by your aunt's, coming and going to bupyung for the girl?
you never know how much hard time i went through for you.
she even intends to introduce a girl to you.
where are you going?
i'm cleverer than i look.
these girls sure love chinese food.
hey, you!
where you headed?
come here!
i'm delivering chinese food.
i ordered it.
bring it here.
bring a lot of radish?
oh, i forgot something!
give me the food first!
that's the wrong way!
there's another customer.
but that wasn't enough for her.
we relived our old high school days.
drink till die!
i've never had anything like this.
sorry, i'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
have a smoke, too!
wow, i've never had a smoke, either!
gonna be a big deal.
i don't smoke well
what are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?
it's a suspension!
you've already had your ups and downs in life.
not to worry.
go ahead and smoke!
hey, you are such a tough cookie!
you go to a very good school!
these clothes are so tight!
after we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
but she got wasted again.
oh, wild teens!
here's a condom.
let's prevent aids.
she's having a happy dream.
compared to when i looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
could her pain be cured now?
maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
excuse me.
can you drive slowly?
have any plans after graduation?
actually, i've never thought about it yet.
can i see what's in your pocket?
it's a condom.
what is this for?
oh, right.
i learned that it prevents aids.
but i haven't used it yet.
 actually, on the way here.
 forget it.
"chicks hen"?
what does this mean?
oh, right.
it's a chicken soup restaurant.
"we'll satisfy all your wishes?"
i think it's to satisfy our tastes.
"hurry and tell him."
how do feel about our daughter?
oh, right.
we're just friends now.
please, don't worry.
if we get closer, i'll let you know, sir.
don't see her any more.
after that day, she never calls me.
it was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
we've broken up.
now, i'm free.
it's me.
come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
i have a blind date today.
come in 45 minutes.
i have a blind date, too.
are you on your way?
i'm on a date with a girl.
hurry up.
i have to go to the bathroom.
"gotta go to the bathroom."
nice to meet you.
i'm cha seokwon.
nice to meet you.
 same here.
 have a seat.
were you really with a girl?
no, i was with a guy.
can i take your order?
coffee, please.
you can drink coke.
i'll drink coffee.
you're very lucky.
i heard a lot about you.
that you're a close friend.
i need to go to the bathroom.
how is he?
no idea but he looks nice.
he is not the man you broke up with, is he?
how do you know?
when you see a new man
forget about the past, all right?
how the hell do you know?
this necklace was given to you from your exboyfriend, isn't it?
you wouldn't wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.
considering your temper and you used to say that you couldn't get over him.
does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world.
that man is the one my mom introduced to me.
she kept pushing me to meet him
doesn't look bad, does he?
hey, listen!
i'm totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.
a man likes something more feminine.
and don't drink a lot.
some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
and it's all right with me, but to the other guys try to surrender just for once don't try to win.
good luck to you.
where's gyeonwoo?
he left already.
he told me ten rules to follow.
i have a good memory.
i'll recite them.
first, don't ask her to be feminine.
and don't
second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
she'll beat someone.
at a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
if she hits you, act like it hurts.
if it hurts, act like it doesn't.
on your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
she'll like it a lot.
make sure you learn fencing and squash.
also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
if she says she'll kill you don't take it lightly.
you'll feel better.
if her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
finally, she likes to write.
encourage her.
ladies and gentlemen, please, pay attention
step back behind the yellow line
after passengers getting off, take in order
please, use the next train.
what's his name?
i'll do it myself.
where are you?
i looked all over for you.
come to the escalator.
you're dead if you don't.
hurry up.
who told you to hug me?
you're supposed to dodge.
sometimes i feel like i know her and sometimes i don't.
we're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
what's going on between us?
can this relationship last forever?
who is it?
it's me, dad.
she told me to write a letter and bring it.
to write it on paper.
to express my feelings,
i tried hard to find the right words.
when i first met her,
i wanted to cure her grief, but now i can't give her up.
i wish we can get serious.
i'm writing about these feelings.
she's probably writing about me now.
this is how we're preparing to split up.
see that mountain top?
could someone hear me from there?
yes, probably so.
or probably not.
then go over there.
i'll shout here.
if you hear, answer me.
you want me to go over there?
can you hear me?
i'm sorry.
i really can't help it.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry
i can't help it.
i thought i was different, but i'm just a helpless girl.
i'm sorry.
did you bring your letter?
what's that?
a time capsule.
we put our letters in it and bury it here.
and two years later, let's meet here again.
we'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
this was her way of saying goodbye, and i kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
let's open this exactly two years later, at two.
we can meet two years later.
when we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
we may become closer, or stay forever apart.
we can only choose one.
you go first.
let's separate here.
should we go together?
no, i'll take the next train.
i think that's better.
see you two years later!
okay, in two years!
two years!
that's how we broke up.
i couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
thinking of those memories,
i started to write about our stories on the internet.
then i made up my mind.
if i meet her again, i'll show her a different me.
got to make use of my time.
for her and my future's sake.
why does the ball i hit keep hitting my face?
i wrote our stories on the internet everyday, and i kept myself busy for two years.
excuse me.
i wrote "my sassy girl".
shin cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
i made her dream come true instead.
i wanted to tell her right away, but i can only wait till that day.
she didn't come.
it's our only day to meet.
no one knows when she will come.
how did he get in here?
it's a mystery.
how are you?
i was so happy while being with you.
i'm not sure if you knew, but the person i loved passed away.
the day when i first met you was the day he died a year before.
actually, i tried to look for him in you.
i know it was wrong.
i'm sorry.
i also met him on the subway like you.
i was really sick at that time.
he did everything i wanted.
like you did to me.
under this tree, we planned our future together.
but he suddenly passed away.
while i was dating you, i met his mother often.
she wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but i couldn't.
the day i first met you, i came under this tree, and i prayed to him.
to let me free.
when i met you, this occurred to me.
that maybe he introduced you to me.
but the more i met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
the more i liked you, i felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
i want to forget him alone.
after that day, i went often to this place.
if i'm not with you after two years, it means i still lack of courage.
how much will we change after two years?
i feel like you live in the future, and i stay in the past.
i want to meet you soon, so i can read your letter.
why are you staring at me, sir?
because you're so pretty.
i thought an angel came down.
do you come here often?
this tree has a secret.
i have a secret here, too.
three years ago, i buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
what's your secret?
so what happened?
we promised to read the letters a year ago.
but i couldn't come.
i guess you're a year late.
but two years didn't seem that long.
i haven't made any decision yet.
i just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
like what?
if we were destined to meet,
i thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
know what fate is?
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
to be honest, i read you guys letters.
i said this tree had a secret, right?
look closely.
does this tree look the same as before?
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
but i'm not sure.
people are dead or alive.
there's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
this tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
it was split into two.
but this young man felt sorry for it.
during this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
when he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.
he said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
it's been a while.
you've gotten prettier.
you still look young.
how have you been?
you were in england?
for one and a half years.
so i can forget him.
i see.
feel better?
a lot better.
is it true now?
my son might be sad.
he won't.
he'll like it this way.
good, that's what i really hoped.
i was getting my photo taken.
you naughty boy.
know how long it's been?
sorry i didn't tell you before.
this is gyeonwoo.
doesn't he resemble him?
when you had a hard time,
i tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
heard you came to bupyung often, but you never visited me?
go out with him.
i thought he'd make things easy for you.
oh, yeah.
gyeonwoo, you're going to england, right?
she's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
i don't have to go now.
you two know each other?
you may not believe it, but i think i met a man from the future.
from your future.
this is how i met her again.
think it's too coincidental?
it's building a bridge of chance for your love.

i'm a typical student.
an engineering major.
i'm smart, but i never study.
my parents can prove that.
gyeonwoo's mom:
you're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
gyeonwoo's father:
since you inherited your brain from me,
gyeonwoo's father:you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
gyeonwoo's mom:
up four points in three years.
gyeonwoo's father:
call this a report card?
gyeonwoo's father:

you were drunk, so
don't stumble, and speak clearly!
you see.
you were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
i saved you from the train.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i thought maybe this girl was a snake.
pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
so i called you honey?
that's right.
i kind of remember that.
you showered to wash off vomit and sweat,
girl:and the police came?
that's right.
would you believe that, too?
gyeonwoo:(monolog) to a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
so i did that, right?
yes, you did.
waitress:(serving coffee) sorry, it's late.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) when she's not drunk, she's just my type.
you look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
are you mocking me?
gyeonwoo:(embarrassed) no, i'm not.
then are you hitting on me?

no matter how pretty she is,
i'm too embarrassed to be with her.

gyeonwoo:(pouring soju) have a drink and calm down.
girl:(sobbing out) huk!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
she's more attractive the closer i look at her.
did you blow your nose on this?
girl:(girl starting to cry) huk huk huk!

the handkerchief is mine.
girl:(crying) to be honest,
i broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.

girl:(girl vomiting) oohack!
gyeonwoo:(gyeonwoo feeling sick at the girl) ack!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i saw her lips.
her white neck.
i saw her breast, too.
while watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
i want to heal her sorrow.
give me some water.
girl:(getting up) hey.
why am i here?
you see.
i'm sorry,
gyeonwoo:but i saw your id, and you're twentyfour.
if you talk down on me again
so what are you gonna do?
just that
give me the towel.
you see, i'm a year older.
then talk like friends.
in the bathroom.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) our relationship is so peculiar.
we met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
that's how our relationship began.
iee hyungchul.
jeun miyoung.
jeun miyoung:
kang mangyu.
gyeonwoo:(briefly) yep.
is he absent?
gyeonwoo:(pretending ignorance) no, no!
i'm here!
then answer right away.
gonna be sucks!
iee jeungmin.
gu seolsoo.
gyeonwoo:(ln a dialect) yes, i'm here.
(the professor giving a lecture)
(her appearance makes the general stir)
(lecture keep going on)
how about a break?
you're right.
let's take a break.
let's go.
go where?
class isn't over yet.
don't be a coward.
he called roll, right?
girl:(charmingly) let's go.
i can't.
i can't miss this class.
kill me instead.
girl:(getting up) all right.
who is she?
she's pretty.
doesn't matter.
a girl needs to act pretty.
friend 1 :
but she's still pretty.
friend 2:
nice body, too.
who's gyeonwoo?
it's me, sir.
i won't mark you absent so you can leave.
gyeonwoo:(surprised) pardon me?
i said leave.
wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
(friends' jeer)
so go see her.
(friends' jeer again)
thank you, sir.
oh, gyeonwoo.
if you can, raise it with her.
girl:(delightfully) it worked.
what did you tell him?
that i'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
gyeonwoo:(screaming) no, no!
professor, it's not true!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) she wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
she called them synopsis.
to get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
reading her synopsis was stressful.
if i miss anything, i'm dead.
wanna die?
finish reading it.
i will.
girl:(flying into a rage) mister!
how could you throw the butt here?
pick it up!
and why did you wear that color?
man on the street:
then what about you?
don't wear the same color as mine!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) the heroine is tough, like the 'terminator'.
the year is 2137.
villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
i don't know why.
to save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
(motorbike's engine going)
(gun firing off)
(gun firing off)
(the sound of shooting a gun) bang!
uuh ack!
fizz bang!
(the bang of a gun's heard all over the place)
(girl and gyeonwoo shooting together) bang!
they have to kiss in the end.
this isn't a melodrama.
it's an action movie.
you don't know movies.
koreans like melodramas.
know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
gyeonwoo:'shower' by hwang sunwon.
it shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
koreans like sad movies all because of 'shower'.
what's sad about it?
it's sad when she asked
gyeonwoo:to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
i couldn't sleep for one week.
the ending sucks.
gotta change it.
gyeonwoo's father:
it's sad.
her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
gyeonwoo's father:
their family line is broken up now.
gyeonwoo's father:
but you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
gyeonwoo's mom:
gyeonwoo's father:
this was her last request.
gyeonwoo's father:
when i die, please bury me with my loving friend.
gyeonwoo's mom:(surprised) what?
gyeonwoo's father:

gyeonwoo's mom:

no way!
this is wrong!

they bury him alive.
isn't it sad?
girl:(ln a sad voice) i must be hurt still.

taxi driver:

gyeonwoo:(monolog) since i'm drunk,
i decided to take revenge on her.
if i'm out cold at bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
(on the air) this stop is bupyung station
cleaning lady:

it's so delicious.
you're very happy to see me, aren't you?
be good to me
girl:and you'll always be with good luck.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) lf i sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hands.
if she's sweeping, it's a broom stick.
if she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
when i'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
so i have to come at the right time.
(the sound of fulling cloth)
gyeonwoo's father:
you studying now?
yes, i'm.
i'm looking over something on the internet.
gyeonwoo's father:
go to bed now.
you too, dad.
gyeonwoo's father:
all right, good night!
good night.
gyeonwoo's father:
ok, then, i'm gonna have a sleep too.
gyeonwoo's father:
you're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
of course not, dad.
you don't trust me?
gyeonwoo's father:(smiling) yes, i do.
time for bed.
gyeonwoo's father:
go to sleep.
good night, dad.
gyeonwoo:(got the mail) uh?
hi, gyeonwoo.
my birthday's in two days.
you're dead if you forget.
got it?
since i like you so much, better make me smile like this.
* * ____
got it?
i got it.
gyeonwoo:(sigh) phew
gyeonwoo:(monolog) her birthday.
if i prepare nothing, she may murder me.
i have a good idea.
before going to the service, i worked in a theme park.
so this is my plan.
at midnight, i'll be alone with her in the park.
it'll be completely dark all around us.
one by one, the lights to the merrygoround flick on.
i raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
then all the lights turn on and it moves.
there's fireworks, too.
isn't it fantastic?
she'll be thrilled.
i gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
jump over here?
we have to.
i always wanted to come here at night.
it's my birthday, not yours.
please, let's just try.
i'll go up first and help you.
there's a step here.
take my hand.
(tumbling down)
(surprised at a deserter)
answer me.
i'm leaving.
i'm leaving.
answer me!
you're dead.
wait till i catch you.
why didn't you answer?
wanna die?
come with me!
(the sound of car passing by)
hurry and get in.
(gyeonwoo screaming)
shut up!
go in fast.
move it.
sit here.
if you're loud, i'll kill you.
got it?
gyeonwoo:(sobbing) yes.
answer quietly!
gyeonwoo:(quietly) yes.
(gyeonwoo startled at her)
is that a real gun?
wanna see?
forget it.
how are you two related?
we're just friends.
i'm not a cat or anything!
go ahead and apologize!
i'll do it.
i'm sorry.
anyway, friends come here late at night?
why are you here?
gyeonwoo:(stammering) we just wanted to come here at night.
tell me the truth, idiot.
nothing special.
what makes you trust a guy like him?
i trusted myself.
deserter:(sigh) i had a girlfriend, too.
she visited me every week for one year.
i was so happy.
i found out the fact after he was discharged.
while i'm in the service, even my dog
deserter:ran away with some mutt, too.
my yorkshire terrier.
i have the worst luck in this world.
know what special day is it today?
this sucks!
(a deserter screaming)
(as if feeling sick) uuuuuuuhhh ack!
hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
don't know.
heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
that's serious.
a teeny bullet does that?
yeah, the bullet tears the
what are you two doing?
stop joking around.
even you bastards ignore me.
that's why don't be foolish.
why am i foolish?
even if you do this, she won't come back.
i know.
i know, too.
but if i die, she'll be heartbroken.
she'll never be the same.
you're wrong.
the pain goes away sooner than you think.
you went through something like this?
it happens that way.
if i'm caught, i'll go to the can.
i'll always think of her there.
what does 'can' mean?
it means prison.
don't interrupt.
anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
excuse me, sir.
how about letting her go?
if i say no?
let me go, instead.
come to think of it,
deserter:your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
you act like him, too.
you can go.
and you
we die together.
got it?
hey, lady.
got it?
let's go together.
all three of us.
will you leave if i kill him?
don't worry too much.
this soldier isn't a bad guy.
you'll come out safely.
gyeonwoo:(sobbing) you're leaving me alone?
there's no other way.
i was afraid to die alone, but i'm glad we're in it together.
(the sound of radio signal)
oh, right.
over there,
gyeonwoo:there's an exit near the merrygoround.
nobody knows about it.
i used to work here.
you're not tricking me, right?
i'm a man, too.
why would i?
walk in front of me.
i told you so.
(the radio signal)
soldier 1 :
this way!
(gyeonwoo screaming and running away)
friend 1 :
what's going on?
it's gyeonwoo.
screw you!
don't come closer!
i'll kill him!
i'll really kill him!
(a deserter shooting in the air)
so she can see me die!
i'll give you an hour!
if not, i'll kill him, and myself, too!
got it?
hurry up!
sniper 2!
the hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
don't shoot!
(the radio signal still going on)
hey, soldier!
i mean sir!
your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
did you really love her?
ask yourself.
i think you didn't.
if you really love her,
girl:you should let her go.
if not, then it's not love.
what's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
stop this,
girl:and go back to base as a real man.
a person like you should learn more about love.
girl:(crying)if we want to learn,
girl:then we should keep living.
she's the nicest girl i've met.
don't let her go.
got it?
if you do, i'll take her.
can i go?
screw it.
friend 1 :
don't know.
(fireworking) pop!
thank you.
today's my birthday.
i'll live on until i learn what love is.
we're just friends?
no, i said that to save you.
let me go, instead?
wanted to save yourself, huh?
he wouldn't have let you go.
stop lying!
stop lying!
stop lying!
have a nice life alone.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i screwed up her birthday, but i feel good anyway.
'cause i'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
i hope you believe in me.
you can't?
second half
i remember.
she always came with him until last year.
was it last spring or autumn?
one day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
to not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
what's up?
oh, hi.
you're early.
i was in the neighborhood.
miss me?
of course!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) she always tried hard to look cheerful.
i like her that way.
what would you like?
coke, please.
wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees, please.
(gyeonwoo grinning) he he he
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i know her.
she pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
what are you doing?
what are you smiling at?
it's nothing.
looks fun, huh?
another one?
don't wanna read it?
gyeonwoo:(monolog) she may get disappointed,
gyeonwoo:but i should be honest for her sake.
looks fun.
i'll read it.
(girl laughing brightly) ha ha ha
the heroine is a bounty hunter.
the villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
the worst of his kind.
(people around a montage in commotion)
man 1 :
what happened?
his name's gyeonwoo?
man 2:
the story's setting is a mess.
japan invades during king sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant yeonsan.
in the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
(cunningly laugh) he he he
(gyeonwoo screaming and running for her) yaaaah
(girl drawing a sword) yup!
the heroine becomes a king.
king jungjo.
she's from the future, of course.
it's fun, huh?
why is the heroine always from the future?
science is advanced then,
girl:so they invent a time machine.
and people go to the past to travel.
people from the future could be here now.
i think ufos are time machines.
someday, i'll meet someone from the future.
i have to.
if you do, ask him to take you.
if it's possible
give this to shin cine.
tell them to cast han sukgyu and shim eunha.
jeon doyun is okay, too.
excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
well this is 'the warrior's sad love story'
(man feeling like vomiting) uuuuuuuugh
(man throwing up) uuuh aaaack!
it's going to be a hit.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) shin cine didn't call back.
hey, kid.
is the subway your sketch book?
don't scribble on it.
wanna die?
my lipstick!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i always take her home, even to bupyung station.
it's something a man must do.
on the way, we play fun games, too.
left foot over the line, i win.
with the right foot, you win.
what's the prize?
let's see
how about a kiss?
girl:(ln a loud voice) a kiss?
wanna die?
you choose.
hitting each other.
you can hit me, too.
someone's coming.
(gyeonwoo laughing) ha ha ha!
i think this is unfair.
i'm a girl, so i'll slap the cheek.
then i'll change it, too.
but i'm a girl.
men and women are equal.
okay, then.
you slap, and i slap, too.
go easy on me, and i'll kill you.
better slap me on the cheek.
if you don't, i'll kill you!
all right.
you slap, and i'll use my finger.
right, that's fair.
saw that?
see that guy step over with his left foot?
i had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
i thought it was this way.
shut up.
here they come.
a staff sergeant:
left foot.
left foot.
it'll be the right foot.
a staff sergeant:
switch to the right.
you have to hit me?
you know why the sky is blue?
gyeonwoo:'cause the reflection of the sunshine.
it's for me!
i want it to be blue.
so, it's blue.
you know why the fire is hot?
it's all for me.
i want it to be hot.
so it is.
you know why we have four seasons here in korea.
because of you.
that's correct!
and why you were born here?
it's for me as well.
that's nonsense.
i was born before you.
you know the word of 'worship'?
girl:'peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of jesus.' huh?
yeah, i know.
so, get ready!
come here.
stay still.
uh uh uh!
(passengers surprised)
gyeonwoo:(monolog) when i'm with her,
i never know how the day will turn out.
what are you looking at?
i quit!
is your face a racket?
gyeonwoo:(monolog) why does the ball always hit my face?
it's strange.
(gyeonwoo screaming) ugh!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i never want to lose a game.
so i play until i win.
(gyeonwoo screaming and running) aaaaaaaaah!
(gyeonwoo groaning) ugh!
wait long?
just a teeny bit.
my mom bought me these heels,
girl:but they're killing my feet.
want a massage?
no, it's okay.
instead, let's exchange shoes.
don't wanna?
how can a guy wear heels?
it'll fit.
but, i can't
i see.
come on.
i'll buy you some sneakers.
forget it.
then wear mine, and i'll carry yours.
you don't understand women.
let's exchange.
wanna know a secret?
what is it?
but i had one today.
catch me, honey!
if you don't, i'll kill you.
phew girl:
catch me, honey!
stop right there!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) it was just a second, but i felt something in her eyes.
that's my house.
i'll bring you an umbrella.
i'm okay.
i'm already wet so i'll just leave.
girl's father:
are you my daughter's boyfriend?
yes, sir.
girl's father:
how much do you know about my daughter?
not much
girl's father:
next time, don't hang out till late.
girl's mom:
you don't understand me.
girl's mom:
why'd you stand him up?
girl's mom:
what's wrong with him?
why do you stand guys up?
girl's mom:
and what happened to your heels?
girl's mom:
what's wrong with you?
girl's mom:
i told you not to meet gyeonwoo.
girl's mom:
he's dumb and has no future.
it's none of your business.
why is he stupid?
you're stupid so you don't know.
girl's mom:
what has gotten in to you?
let me live my own life!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) afterwards,
i didn't hear from her for a long time.
(cellular phone ringing)
gyeonwoo, it's me.
long time no see.
her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
our 100th day celebration is soon.
it's 100 days already?
when do you think a girl's the prettiest?
when a sexy woman is naked.
where are you now?
stay right there.
no, i'm just kidding.
the prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
what's your favorite song?
that george winston song.
(gyeonwoo humming) ta la la la la la ta la
pachelbel's 'canon'?
yeah, that song.
you're not gonna ask me?
when is the guy the prettiest?
just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
bring it on our 100th day,
girl:and give me a rose during my class.
do it yourself, okay?
what did you say?
how can i during class?
just hung up on me!
(students shouting to be quiet)
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
gyeonwoo's mom:
oh my god!
a burglar!
gyeonwoo's mom:
help, a burglar!
gyeonwoo's mom:
are you crazy?
you're gonna break into where?
gyeonwoo's mom:
what on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
gyeonwoo's mom:
and you
gyeonwoo's mom:
why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going bupyung for the girl.
gyeonwoo's mom:
you never know how much hard time i went through for you.
gyeonwoo's mom:
she even intends to introduce a girl to you.
gyeonwoo's mom:
where are you going?
i'm cleverer than i look.
these girls sure love chinese food.
hey, you!
where you headed?
come here!
i'm delivering chinese food.
i ordered it.
bring it here.
bring a lot of radish?
oh, i forgot something!
give me the food first!
that's the wrong way!
there's another customer.
(classroom in commotion) (becoming as silent as death)
(again in commotion)
(pachelbel's 'canon' begins to be played)
(students clapping and shouting)
gyeonwoo:(monolog) but that wasn't enough for her.
we relived our old high school days.
drink till die!
i've never had anything like this.
sorry, i'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
have a smoke, too!
wow, i've never had a smoke, either!
gonna be a big deal.
i don't smoke well
what are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
it's a suspension!
you've already had your ups and downs in life.
go ahead and smoke!
hey, you are such a tough cookie!
you go to very good school!
not to worry.
this clothes is so tight!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) after we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
but she got wasted again.
condom man:
oh, wild teens!
here's a condom.
condom man:
let's prevent aids.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) she's having a happy dream.
compared to when i looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
could her pain be cured now?
maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
excuse me.
can you drive slowly?
girl's father:
girl's father:
have any plans after graduation?
actually, i've never thought about it yet.
girl's father:
can i see what's in your pocket?
(girl's mom mumbling without sound) 'lt's a condom.'
girl's father:
what is this for?
oh, right.
i learned that it prevents aids.
but i haven't used it yet.
actually, on the way here.
girl's father:
forget it.
girl's father:'chicks hen'?
what does this mean?
oh, right.
it's a chicken soup restaurant.
girl's father:'we'll satisfy all your wishes?
i think it's to satisfy our tastes.
girl's mom:(without sound) 'hurry and tell him.'
girl's father:
how do feel about our daughter?
oh, right.
we're just friends now.
please don't worry.
if we get closer, i'll let you know, sir.
girl's father:
don't see her any more.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) after that day, she never calls me.
it was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
we're broken up.
now, i'm free.
(cellular phone ringing)
it's me.
come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
i have a blind date today.
come in 45 minutes.
i have a blind date, too.
(gyeonwoo surprised)
(cellular phone ringing)
are you on your way?
i'm on a date with a girl.
hurry up.
i have to go to the bathroom.
gyeonwoo:'gotta go to the bathroom.'
gyeonwoo:(ln amazement) eh?
(gyeonwoo sobbing as he feels mistreated)
nice to meet you.
i'm cha seokwon.
nice to meet you.
same here.
have a seat.
were you really with a girl?
no, i was with a guy.
can i take your order?
coffee, please.
you can drink coke.
i'll drink coffee.
you're very lucky.
i heard a lot about you.
that you're close friend.
i need to go to the bathroom.
how is he?
no idea
but he looks nice.
he is not the man you broke up with, is he?
how do you know?
when you see a new man
gyeonwoo:forget about the past, all right?
how the hell do you know?
this necklace is given from your exboyfriend, isn't it?
you wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
considering your temper
and you
gyeonwoo:used to tell that you couldn't get over him.
does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world?
that man is the one my mom introduced me to meet.
she kept pushing me to meet him
doesn't look bad guy, does he?
hey, listen!
i'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
man likes something more feminine.
and don't drink a lot.
some of guys aim at the girls intoxicated.
and it's all right with me, but to the other guys
gyeonwoo:try to surrender for just once.
gyeonwoo: not try to win.
good luck to you.
where's gyeonwoo?
he left already.
he told me ten rules to follow.
i have a good memory.
i'll recite them.
first, don't ask her to be feminine.
and don't
second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
she'll beat someone.
at a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
if she hits you, act like it hurts.
if it hurts, act like it doesn't.
on your 100th day together,
gyeonwoo:give her a rose during her class.
she'll like it a lot.
make sure you learn fencing and squash.
also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
if she says she'll kill you,
gyeonwoo:don't take it lightly.
you'll feel better.
if her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
finally, she likes to write.
encourage her.
(girl breathing hard)
(station attendant) ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention to here
station attendant:
step backward on the yellow line
station attendant: after passenger's getting off, take in order
station attendant:please use the next train.
station attendant:
what's his name?
i'll do it myself.
where are you?
i looked all over for you.
come to the escalator.
you're dead if you don't.
hurry up.
who told you to hug me?
(gyeonwoo screaming)
you're supposed to dodge.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) sometimes i feel like i know her and sometimes i don't.
we're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
what's going on between us?
can this relationship last forever?
(doorbell ringing)
girl's father:
who is it?
it's me, dad.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) she told me to write a letter and bring it.
to write it on paper.
to express my feelings,
i tried hard to find the right words.
when i first met her,
i wanted to cure her grief, but now i can't give her up.
i wish we can get serious.
i'm writing about these feelings.
she's probably writing about me now.
this is how we're preparing to split up.
(bird twittering around)
see that mountain top?
could someone hear me from there?
yes, probably so.
or probably not.
then go over there.
i'll shout here.
if you hear, answer me.
you want me to go over there?
can you hear me?
i'm sorry.
i really can't help it.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry
i can't help it.
i thought i was different, but i'm just a helpless girl.
i'm sorry.
did you bring your letter?
what's that?
a time capsule.
we put our letters in it and bury it here.
and two years later, let's meet here again.
we'll read the letters that day,
girl:and maybe we can find an answer then.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) this was her way of saying goodbye, and i kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
gyeonwoo:(monolog) we can meet two years later.
when we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
we may become closer, or stay forever apart.
we can only choose one.
you go first.
let's separate here.
should we go together?
no, i'll take the next train.
i think that's better.
see you two years later!
okay, in two years!
two years!
gyeonwoo:(monolog) that's how we broke up.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
thinking of those memories,
i started to write about our stories on the internet.
then i made up my mind.
if i meet her again, i'll show her a different myself.
got to make use of my time.
for her and my future's sake.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) why does the ball i hit keep hitting my face?
gyeonwoo:(monolog) i wrote our stories on the internet everyday, and i kept myself busy for two years.
(gulp gulp) (shouting) yup!
excuse me.
i wrote 'my sassy girl'.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) shin cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
i made her dream come true instead.
i wanted to tell her right away, but i can only wait till that day.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) she didn't come.
it's our only day to meet.
no one knows when she will come.
(gyeonwoo crying out in surprise) wow!
how did he get in here?
it's a mystery.
how are you?
i was so happy while being with you.
i'm not sure if you knew, but the person i loved passed away.
the day when i first met you was the day he died a year ago.
actually, i tried to look for him in you.
i know it was wrong.
i'm sorry.
i also met him on the subway like you.
i was really sick at that time.
he did everything i wanted.
like you did to me.
under this tree, we planned our future together.
but he suddenly passed away.
while i was dating you, i met his mother often.
she wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but i couldn't.
the day i first met you, i came under this tree, and i prayed to him.
to let me free.
when i met you, this occurred to me.
that maybe
he introduced you to me.
but the more i met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
the more i liked you, i felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
i want to forget him alone.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) after that day, i went often to this place.
if i'm not with you after two years, it means i still lack of courage.
how much will we change after two years?
i feel like you live in the future, and i stay in the past.
i want to meet you soon, so i can read your letter.
why are you staring at me, sir?
old man:
because you're so pretty.
i thought an angel came down.
do you come here often?
old man:
this tree has a secret.
i have a secret here, too.
old man:
three years ago, i buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
what's your secret?
old man:
so what happened?
we promised to read the letters a year ago.
but i couldn't come.
old man:
i guess you're a year late.
but two years didn't seem that long.
i haven't made any decision yet.
i just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
old man:
like what?
if we were destined to meet,
i thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
old man:
know what fate is?
old man:
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
old man:
to be honest, i read you guys letters.
old man:
i said this tree had a secret, right?
old man:
look closely.
does this tree look the same as before?
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
but i'm not sure.
old man:
people are dead or alive.
old man:
there's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
old man:
this tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
old man:
it was split into two.
old man:
but this young man felt sorry for it.
old man:
during this spring,
old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
old man:
when he planted the tree,
old man:he asked me if it look the same.
old man:
he said that someone would be sad if it died,
old man:so no one should know.
(recorded mechanical voice) you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
it's been a while.
you've gotten prettier.
you still look young.
how have you been?
you were in england?
for one and a half years.
so i can forget him.
i see.
feel better?
a lot better.
is it true now?
my son might be sad.
he won't.
he'll like it this way.
good, that's what i really hoped.
i was getting my photo taken.
you naughty boy.
know how long it's been?
sorry i didn't tell you before.
this is gyeonwoo.
doesn't he resemble him?
when you had a hard time,
i tried to introduce you to him for several years,
auntie:but he kept getting out of it.
heard you came to bupyung often,
auntie:but you never visited me?
go out with him.
i thought he'd make things easy for you.
oh, yeah.
gyeonwoo, you're going to england, right?
she's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
i don't have to go now.
you two know each other?
you may not believe it, but i think i met a man from the future.
from your future.
gyeonwoo:(monolog) this is how i met her again.
think it's too coincidental?
it's building a bridge of chance for your love.

first half
he hasn't changed at all.

why aren't you at your aunt's house?
i'm leaving soon.
keep quiet!
it's my mom!
talk over there!
make sure you pay a visit.
it's been over a year since you saw her.
that long?
you know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
she says you resemble him.
she'll be so glad to see you.
still there?
we don't look alike.
plus, i hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
uncle does, too.
she'll introduce you to a girl.
i know the type she likes.
tell her no thanks.
i want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
but on that day
she's my type, but i don't like her.
drunk girls disgust me.

nothing's there when you need it.
where did all those motels go?
i hate being with a drunk girl.

your aunt said you didn't come!
and you're telling me a lie!
what happened to your sweater?
i'm such a poor guy.
all this because of a drunk girl.
i wanna die.
you asked if i went to bupyung!
i did, but not to see auntie!
wait till he comes back.
know me now, right?
i'm a typical student.
an engineering major.
i'm smart, but i never study.
my parents can prove that.
you're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
up four points in three years.
call this a report card?
since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
if you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
they'll never study.
my goals?
haven't thought about it yet.
you know now?
you got it.
i'm a hopeless student.
who's calling?
why were you naked in a motel with me?
come out!
to bupyung station now!
how could she do this?
i went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
excuse me.
is it you?
follow me.
get over here.
what do you wanna eat?
cherry jubilee
mango tango or shooting stars
jamonka almonds good, too.
i'll just have a love me.
hey, wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees.
you pay for it.
tell me.
what happened last night?
well, it's
you were drunk, so
don't stumble, and speak clearly!
you see.
you were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
i saved you from the train.
i thought maybe this girl was a snake.
pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
so i called you honey?
that's right.
i kind of remember that.
you showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
that's right.
would you believe that, too?
to a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
so i did that, right?
yes, you did.
sorry, it's late. yeah
when she's not drunk, she's just my type.
you look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
are you mocking me?
no, i'm not.
then are you hitting on me?
i don't wanna date you.
we're not destined for each other.
throw the trash away.
i think she's a heavy drinker.
you order.
kimchi soup and soju, please.
eat golbangee.
then you should order.
stop pouting!
golbangee, please.
let's go somewhere fun later.
i know what that means.
a motel?
are you rich?
 of course.
how much will you give us?
we'll see, so don't worry.
you kids are prostituting, huh?
why'd you order golbangee?
eat something else!
what's it to you?
mind your own business.
we're just having a drink with some friends.
what's wrong?
you take friends to a motel?
how old are you kids?
old enough to drink.
mind your own business.
think i'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
show me your id.
you, too.
what's with you?
show it, now.
this sucks.
she's a vicious chick.
no matter how pretty she is,
i'm too embarrassed to be with her.
who are you to butt in other people's business?
don't you have a daughter?
 i don't.
bear me one.
who the hell do you think you are?
how dare you?
come on, let's fight!
come on!
i'll show you.
don't live like that!
catch up with the girls.
have a drink and calm down.
seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
she's more attractive the closer i look at her.
did you blow your nose on this?
please stop crying.
the handkerchief is mine.
to be honest,
i broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
excuse me.
wake up.
come on, wake up.
your fiances wasted again?
what now?
sign you in like before, right?
but mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
no, you buy it.
where did you go, honey?
what is it?
 uh!
i saw her lips.
her white neck.
i saw her breast, too.
while watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
i want to heal her sorrow.
give me some water.
why am i here?
you see.
i'm sorry, but i saw your id, and you're twentyfour.
if you talk down on me again
so what are you gonna do?
just that
give me the towel.
you see, i'm a year older.
then talk like friends. yeah?
in the bathroom.
our relationship is so peculiar.
we met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
that's how our relationship began.
lee hyungchui.
jeun miyoung.
kang mangyu.
is he absent?
no, no!
i'm here!
then answer right away.
gonna be sucks!
lee jeungmin.
gu seoisoo.
(in a dialect) yes, i'm here.
how about a break?
you're right.
let's take a break.
let's go.
go where?
class isn't over yet.
don't be a coward.
he called roll, right?
let's go.
i can't.
i can't miss this class.
kill me instead.
all right.
who is she?
she's pretty.
doesn't matter.
a girl needs to act pretty.
but she's still pretty.  nice body, too.
who's gyeonwoo?
it's me, sir.
i won't mark you absent so you can leave.
pardon me?
i said leave.
wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
so go see her.
thank you, sir.
oh, gyeonwoo.
if you can, raise it with her.
it worked.
what did you tell him?
that i'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
no, no!
professor, it's not true!
she wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
she called them synopsis.
to get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
reading her synopsis was stressful.
if i miss anything, i'm dead.
wanna die?
finish reading it.
i will.
how could you throw the butt here?
pick it up!
and why did you wear that color?
then what about you?
don't wear the same color as mine!
the heroine is tough, like the 'terminator'.
the year is 2137.
villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
i don't know why.
to save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
they have to kiss in the end.
this isn't a melodrama.
it's an action movie.
you don't know movies.
koreans like melodramas.
know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
shower by hwang sunwon.
it shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
koreans like sad movies all because of 'shower'.
what's sad about it?
it's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
i couldn't sleep for one week.
the ending sucks.
gotta change it.
it's sad.
her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
their family line is broken up now.
but you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
gyeonwoo's mother:
this was her last request.
when i die, please bury me with my loving friend.
gyeonwoo's mother:
to bury him alive, even.
oh, my gosh.
what's the matter?
 what's wrong?
no way!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!
bury him!
they bury him alive.
isn't it sad?
i must be hurt still.
i think i'll never get over him.
how deep could it be?
i don't know.
gyeonwoo, go in the water.
i wanna know how deep it is.
come on.
help me!
help me!
wow, it's deep.
i can't swim!
yes, it's deep
my mind was getting blurry.
at that moment
heard you got a girlfriend.
introduce me.
 i'm serious.
is she pretty?
have you kissed her?
gonna introduce me or not?
she really pretty?
what are you looking at?
see that girl over there?
she's my girlfriend from today.

it's so delicious.
you're very happy to see me, aren't you?
be good to me and you'll always be with good luck.
if i sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
if she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
if she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
when i'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
so i have to come at the right time.
you studying now?
yes, i'm.
i'm looking over something on the internet.
go to bed now. you too, dad.
all right, good night!
good night.
ok then, i'm gonna have a sleep too.

of course not, dad.
you don't trust me?
no, i do.
time for bed.
go to sleep. good night, dad.
hi, gyeonwoo.
my birthday's in two days.
you're dead if you forget.
got it?
since i like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * ¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬
got it?
i got it.
her birthday.
if i prepare nothing, she may murder me.
i have a good idea.
before going to the service, i worked in a theme park.
so this is my plan.
at midnight, i'll be alone with her in the park.
it'll be completely dark all around us.
one by one, the lights to the merrygoround flick on.
i raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
then all the lights turn on and it moves.
there's fireworks, too.
isn't it fantastic?
she'll be thrilled.
i gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
jump over here?
we have to.
i always wanted to come here at night.
it's my birthday, not yours.
please, let's just try.
i'll go up first and help you.
there's a step here.
take my hand.
answer me.
i'm leaving.
i'm leaving.
answer me!
you're dead.
wait till i catch you.
why didn't you answer?
wanna die?
come with me!
hurry and get in.
shut up!
go in fast.
move it.
sit here.
if you're loud, i'll kill you.
got it?
answer quietly!
 yes.
is that a real gun?
wanna see?
 forget it.
how are you two related?
we're just friends.
i'm not a cat or anything!
go ahead and apolize!
i'll do it.
i'm sorry.
anyway, friends come here late at night?
why are you here?
we just wanted to come here at night.
tell me the truth, idiot.  nothing special.
what makes you trust a guy like him?
i trusted myself.
i had a girlfriend, too.
she visited me every week for one year.
i was so happy.
i found out the fact after he was discharged.
while i'm in the service, even my dog ran away with some mutt, too.
my yorkshire terrier.
i have the worst luck in this world.
know what special day is it today?
this sucks!
hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
don't know.
heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
that's serious.
a teeny bullet does that?
yeah, the bullet tears the
what are you two doing?
stop joking around.
even you bastards ignore me.
that's why don't be foolish. why am i foolish?
even if you do this, she won't come back.
i know. i know, too.
but if i die, she'll be heartbroken.
she'll never be the same.
you're wrong.
the pain goes away sooner than you think.
you went through something like this?
it happens that way.
if i'm caught, i'll go to the can.
i'll always think of her there.
what does 'can' mean?
it means prison.
don't interrupt. sorry.
anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
excuse me, sir.
how about letting her go?
if i say no?
then let me go, instead.
come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
you act like him, too.
you can go.
and you
we die together.
got it?
hey, lady.
got it?
 let's go together.
all three of us.
will you leave if i kill him?
don't worry too much.
this soldier isn't a bad guy.
you'll come out safely.
you're leaving me alone?
there's no other way.
i was afraid to die alone, but i'm glad we're in it together.
oh, right.
over there, there's an exit near the merrygoround.
nobody knows about it.
i used to work here.
you're not tricking me, right?
i'm a man, too.
why would i?
walk in front of me.
i told you so.
this way!
what's going on?
it's gyeonwoo.
screw you!
don't come closer!
i'll kill him!
i'll really kill him!
so she can see me die!
i'll give you an hour!
if not, i'll kill him, and myself, too!
got it?
hurry up!
sniper 2!
the hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
don't shoot!
hey, soldier!
i mean sir!
your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
did you really love her?
ask yourself.
i think you didn't.
if you really love her, you should let her go.
if not, then it's not love.
what's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
a person like you should learn more about love.
if we want to learn, then we should keep living.
she's the nicest girl i've met.
don't let her go.
got it?
if you do, i'll take her.
can i go?
screw it.
don't know.
thank you.
today's my birthday.
i'll live on until i learn what love is.
we're just friends?
no, i said that to save you.
let me go, instead?
wanted to save yourself, huh?
he wouldn't have let you go.
stop lying!
stop lying!
stop lying!
have a nice life alone.
i screwed up her birthday, but i feel good anyway.
'cause i'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
i hope you believe in me.
you can't?
second half
i remember.
she always came with him until last year.
was it last spring or winter?
one day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
to not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
what's up?
oh, hi.
you're early.
i was in the neighborhood.
miss me?
of course!
she always tried hard to look cheery.
i like her that way. what would you like?
coke, please.
wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees, please.
he he he
i know her.
she pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
what are you doing?
what are you smiling at?
it's nothing.
looks fun, huh?
another one?
don't wanna read it?
she may get disappointed, but i should be honest for her sake.
looks fun.
i'll read it.
this time it's a martial arts film.
the heroine is a bounty hunter.
the villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
the worst of his kind.
what happened?
his name's gyeonwoo?
the story's setting is a mess.
japan invades during king sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant yeonsan.
in the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
the heroine becomes a king.
king jungjo.
she's from the future, of course.
it's fun, huh?
why is the heroine always from the future?
science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
and people go to the past to travel.
people from the future could be here now.
i think ufos are time machines.
someday, i'll meet someone from the future.
i have to.
if you do, ask him to take you.
if it's possible
give this to shin cine.
tell them to cast han sukgyu and shim eunha.
jeon doyun is okay, too.
excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
well this is 'the warrior's sad love story'
it's going to be a hit.
shin cine didn't call back.
hey, kid.
is the subway your sketch book?
don't scribble on it.
wanna die?
my lipstick!
i always take her home, even to bupyung station.
it's something a man must do.
on the way, we play fun games, too.
left foot over the line, i win.
with the right foot, you win.
what's the prize?
let's see
how about a kiss?
a kiss?
wanna die?
you choose.
hitting each other.
you can hit me, too.
someone's coming.
i think this is unfair.
i'm a girl, so i'ii slap the cheek.
then i'ii change it, too.
but i'm a girl. men and women are equal.
okay, then.
you slap, and i slap, too.
go easy on me, and i'ii kill you.
better slap me on the cheek.
if you don't, i'ii kill you!
aii right.
you slap, and i'ii use my finger.
right, that's fair.
saw that?
see that guy step over with his left foot?
i had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
i thought it was this way.
shut up.
here they come.
left foot.
left foot.
it'ii be the right foot.
switch to the right.
you have to hit me?
you know why the sky is blue?
'cause the reflection of the sunshine.
it's for me!
i want it to be blue.
so, it's blue.
you know why the fire is hot?
it's all for me.
i want it to be hot.
so it is.
you know why we have four seasons here in korea.
because of you. that's correct!
and why you were born here?
it's for me as well. what?
that's nonsense.
i was born before you.
you know the word of 'worship'?
'peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of jesus.' huh?
yeah, i know.
so, get ready!
come here.
stay still.
when i'm with her,
i never know how the day will turn out.
what are you looking at?
i quit!
is your face a racket?
why does the ball always hit my face?
it's strange.
i never want to lose a game.
so i play until i win.
wait long?
just a teeny bit.
my mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
want a massage?
no, it's okay.
instead, iet's exchange shoes.
don't wanna?
how can a guy wear heels?
it'ii fit.
but, i can't
i see.
come on.
i'ii buy you some sneakers.
forget it.
then wear mine, and i'ii carry yours.
you don't understand women.
let's exchange.
wanna know a secret?
what is it?
but i had one today.
catch me, honey!
if you don't, i'ii kill you.
phew catch me, honey!
stop right there!
it was just a second, but i felt something in her eyes.
that's my house.
i'ii bring you an umbrella.
i'm okay.
i'm already wet so i'ii just leave.
are you my daughter's boyfriend?
yes, sir.
how much do you know about my daughter?
not much
next time, don't hang out till late.
you don't understand me.
why'd you stand him up?
what's wrong with him?
why do you stand guys up?
and what happened to your heels?
what's wrong with you?
i told you not to meet gyeonwoo.
he's dumb and has no future.
it's none of your business.
why is he stupid?
you're stupid so you don't know.
what has gotten in to you?
let me live my own life!
i didn't hear from her for a iong time.
 gyeonwoo, it's me.
long time no see.
her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
our 100th day celebration is soon.
it's 100 days already?
when do you think a girl's the prettiest?
when a sexy woman is naked.
where are you now?
stay right there.
no, i'm just kidding.
the prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
what's your favorite song?
that george winston song.
pacheibei canon?
yeah, that song.
you're not gonna ask me?
when is the guy the prettiest?
just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
do it yourself, okay?
what did you say?
how can i during class?
just hung up on me!
i don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
oh my god!
a burglar!
help, a burglar!
are you crazy?
you're gonna break into where?
what on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
and you
why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going bupyung for the girl.
you never know how much hard time i went through for you.
she even intends to introduce a girl to you.
where are you going?
i'm cleverer than i iook.
these girls sure love chinese food.
hey, you!
where you headed?
come here!
i'm delivering chinese food.
i ordered it.
bring it here.
bring a iot of radish?
oh, i forgot something!
give me the food first!
that's the wrong way!
there's another customer.
but that wasn't enough for her.
we relived our old high school days.
drink till die!
i've never had anything like this.
sorry, i'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
have a smoke, too!
wow, i've never had a smoke, either!
gonna be a big deal.
i don't smoke well
what are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
it's a suspension!
you've already had your ups and downs in life.
not to worry.
go ahead and smoke!
hey, you are such a tough cookie!
you go to a very good school!
these clothes are so tight!
after we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
but she got wasted again.
oh, wild teens!
here's a condom.
let's prevent aids.
she's having a happy dream.
compared to when i looked at her in the motel the first time,
she looks so different.
could her pain be cured now?
maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
excuse me.
can you drive slowly?
have any plans after graduation?
actually, i've never thought about it yet.
can i see what's in your pocket?
it's a condom.
what is this for?
oh, right.
i learned that it prevents aids.
but i haven't used it yet.
actually, on the way here.  forget it.
'chicks hen'?
what does this mean?
oh, right.
it's a chicken soup restaurant.
'we'll satisfy all your wishes?
i think it's to satisfy our tastes.
'hurry and tell him.'
how do feel about our daughter?
oh, right.
we're just friends now.
please don't worry.
if we get closer, i'll let you know, sir.
don't see her any more.
after that day, she never calls me.
it was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
we've broken up.
now, i'm free.
it's me.
come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
i have a blind date today.
come in 45 minutes.
i have a blind date, too.
are you on your way?
i'm on a date with a girl.
hurry up.
i have to go to the bathroom.
'gotta go to the bathroom.'
nice to meet you.
i'm cha seokwon.
nice to meet you.
same here.  have a seat.
were you really with a girl?
no, i was with a guy.
can i take your order?
coffee, please.
you can drink coke.
i'll drink coffee.
you're very lucky.
i heard a lot about you.
that you're a close friend.
i need to go to the bathroom.
how is he?
no idea but he looks nice.
he is not the man you broke up with, is he?
how do you know?
when you see a new man
forget about the past, all right?
how the hell do you know?
this necklace is given from your exboyfriend, isn't it?
you wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
considering your temper and you used to say that you couldn't get over him.
does that means he isn't here anymore in this world.
that man is the one my mom introduced to me.
she kept pushing me to meet him doesn't look bad, does he?
hey, listen!
i'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
man likes something more feminine.
and don't drink a lot.
some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
and it's all right with me, but to the other guys try to surrender for just once.
 not try to win.
good luck to you.
where's gyeonwoo?
he left already.
he told me ten rules to follow.
i have a good memory.
i'll recite them.
first, don't ask her to be feminine.
and don't
second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
she'll beat someone.
at a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
if she hits you, act like it hurts.
if it hurts, act like it doesn't.
on your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
she'll like it a lot.
make sure you learn fencing and squash.
also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
if she says she'll kill you, don't take it lightly.
you'll feel better.
if her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
finally, she likes to write.
encourage her.
ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention
step back behind the yellow line
after passengers getting off, take in order
please use the next train.
what's his name?
i'll do it myself.
where are you?
i looked all over for you.
come to the escalator.
you're dead if you don't.
hurry up.
who told you to hug me?
you're supposed to dodge.
sometimes i feel like i know her and sometimes i don't.
we're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
what's going on between us?
can this relationship last forever?
who is it?
it's me, dad.
she told me to write a letter and bring it.
to write it on paper.
to express my feelings,
i tried hard to find the right words.
when i first met her,
i wanted to cure her grief, but now i can't give her up.
i wish we can get serious.
i'm writing about these feelings.
she's probably writing about me now.
this is how we're preparing to split up.
see that mountain top?
could someone hear me from there?
yes, probably so.
or probably not.
then go over there.
i'll shout here.
if you hear, answer me.
you want me to go over there?
can you hear me?
i'm sorry.
i really can't help it.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry
i can't help it.
i thought i was different, but i'm just a helpless girl.
i'm sorry.
did you bring your letter?
what's that?
a time capsule.
we put our letters in it and bury it here.
and two years later, let's meet here again.
we'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
this was her way of saying goodbye, and i kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
we can meet two years later.
when we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
we may become closer, or stay forever apart.
we can only choose one.
you go first.
let's separate here.
should we go together?
no, i'll take the next train.
i think that's better.
see you two years later!
okay, in two years!
two years!
that's how we broke up.
over time
i couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
thinking of those memories,
i started to write about our stories on the internet.
then i made up my mind.
if i meet her again, i'll show her a different me.
got to make use of my time.
for her and my future's sake.
why does the ball i hit keep hitting my face?
i wrote our stories on the internet everyday, and i kept myself busy for two years.
excuse me.
i wrote 'my sassy girl'.
shin cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
i made her dream come true instead.
i wanted to tell her right away, but i can only wait till that day.
she didn't come.
it's our only day to meet.
no one knows when she will come.
how did he get in here?
it's a mystery.
how are you?
i was so happy while being with you.
i'm not sure if you knew, but the person i loved passed away.
the day when i first met you was the day he died a year ago.
actually, i tried to look for him in you.
i know it was wrong.
i'm sorry.
i also met him on the subway like you.
i was really sick at that time.
he did everything i wanted.
like you did to me.
under this tree, we planned our future together.
but he suddenly passed away.
while i was dating you, i met his mother often.
she wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but i couldn't.
the day i first met you, i came under this tree, and i prayed to him.
to let me free.
when i met you, this occurred to me.
that maybe he introduced you to me.
but the more i met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
the more i liked you, i felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
i want to forget him alone.
after that day, i went often to this place.
if i'm not with you after two years, it means i still lack of courage.
how much will we change after two years?
i feel like you live in the future, and i stay in the past.
i want to meet you soon, so i can read your letter.
why are you staring at me, sir?
because you're so pretty.
i thought an angel came down.
do you come here often?
this tree has a secret.
i have a secret here, too.
three years ago, i buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
what's your secret?
so what happened?
we promised to read the letters a year ago.
but i couldn't come.
i guess you're a year late.
but two years didn't seem that long.
i haven't made any decision yet.
i just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
like what?
if we were destined to meet,
i thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
know what fate is?
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
to be honest, i read you guys letters.
i said this tree had a secret, right?
look closely.
does this tree look the same as before?
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
but i'm not sure.
people are dead or alive.
there's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
this tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
it was split into two.
but this young man felt sorry for it.
during this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
when he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
he said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
it's been a while.
you've gotten prettier.
you still look young.
how have you been?
you were in england?
for one and a half years.
so i can forget him.
i see.
feel better?
a lot better.
is it true now?
my son might be sad.
he won't.
he'll like it this way.
good, that's what i really hoped.
i was getting my photo taken.
you naughty boy.
know how long it's been?
sorry i didn't tell you before.
this is gyeonwoo.
doesn't he resemble him?
when you had a hard time,
i tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
heard you came to bupyung often, but you never visited me?
go out with him.
i thought he'd make things easy for you.
oh, yeah.
gyeonwoo, you're going to england, right?
she's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
i don't have to go now.
you two know each other?
you may not believe it, but i think i met a man from the future.
from your future.
this is how i met her again.
think it's too coincidental?
it's building a bridge of chance for your love.

i'm leaving soon.
keep quiet!
it's my mom!

make sure you pay a visit.
it's been over a year since you saw her.
that long?
you know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
she says you resemble him.
she'll be so glad to see you.
still there?
we don't look alike.
plus, i hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
uncle does, too.
she'll introduce you to a girl.
i know the type she likes.
tell her no thanks.
i want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
but on that day
she's my type, but i don't like her.
drunk girls disgust me.

i wanna die.
you asked if i went to bupyung!
i did, but not to see auntie!
wait till he comes back.
know me now, right?
i'm a typical student.
an engineering major.
i'm smart, but i never study.
my parents can prove that.
you're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
up four points in three years.
call this a report card?
since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
if you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
they'll never study.
my goals?
haven't thought about it yet.
you know now?
you got it.
i'm a hopeless student.
who's calling?
why were you naked in a motel with me?
come out!
to bupyung station now!
how could she do this?
i went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
excuse me.
is it you?
follow me.
get over here.
what do you wanna eat?
cherry jubilee
mango tango or shooting stars
jamonka almonds good, too.
i'll just have a love me.
hey, wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees.
you pay for it.
tell me.
what happened last night?
well, it's
you were drunk, so
don't stumble, and speak clearly!
you see.
you were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
i saved you from the train.
i thought maybe this girl was a snake.
pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
so i called you honey?
that's right.
i kind of remember that.
you showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
that's right.
would you believe that, too?
to a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
so i did that, right?
yes, you did.
sorry, it's late. yeah
when she's not drunk, she's just my type.
you look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
are you mocking me?
no, i'm not.
then are you hitting on me?
i don't wanna date you.
we're not destined for each other.
throw the trash away.
i think she's a heavy drinker.
you order.
kimchi soup and soju, please.
eat golbangee.
then you should order.
stop pouting!
golbangee, please.
let's go somewhere fun later.
i know what that means.
a motel?
are you rich?
 of course.
how much will you give us?
we'll see, so don't worry.
you kids are prostituting, huh?
why'd you order golbangee?
eat something else!
what's it to you?
mind your own business.
we're just having a drink with some friends.
what's wrong?
you take friends to a motel?
how old are you kids?
old enough to drink.
mind your own business.
think i'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
show me your id.
you, too.
what's with you?
show it, now.
this sucks.
she's a vicious chick.
no matter how pretty she is,
i'm too embarrassed to be with her.
who are you to butt in other people's business?
don't you have a daughter?
 i don't.
bear me one.
who the hell do you think you are?
how dare you?
come on, let's fight!
come on!
i'll show you.
don't live like that!
catch up with the girls.
have a drink and calm down.
seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
she's more attractive the closer i look at her.
did you blow your nose on this?
please stop crying.
the handkerchief is mine.
to be honest,
i broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
excuse me.
wake up.
come on, wake up.
your fiances wasted again?
what now?
sign you in like before, right?
but mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
no, you buy it.
where did you go, honey?
what is it?
 uh!
i saw her lips.
her white neck.
i saw her breast, too.
while watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
i want to heal her sorrow.
give me some water.
why am i here?
you see.
i'm sorry, but i saw your id, and you're twentyfour.
if you talk down on me again
so what are you gonna do?
just that
give me the towel.
you see, i'm a year older.
then talk like friends. yeah?
in the bathroom.
our relationship is so peculiar.
we met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
that's how our relationship began.
lee hyungchui.
jeun miyoung.
kang mangyu.
is he absent?
no, no!
i'm here!
then answer right away.

lee jeungmin.
gu seoisoo.
(in a dialect) yes, i'm here.
how about a break?
you're right.
let's take a break.
let's go.

class isn't over yet.
don't be a coward.
he called roll, right?
let's go.
i can't.
i can't miss this class.
kill me instead.
all right.
who is she?
she's pretty.
doesn't matter.
a girl needs to act pretty.
but she's still pretty.  nice body, too.
who's gyeonwoo?
it's me, sir.
i won't mark you absent so you can leave.
pardon me?
i said leave.
wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
so go see her.
thank you, sir.
oh, gyeonwoo.
if you can, raise it with her.
it worked.
what did you tell him?
that i'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
no, no!
professor, it's not true!
she wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
she called them synopsis.
to get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
reading her synopsis was stressful.
if i miss anything, i'm dead.
wanna die?
finish reading it.
i will.
how could you throw the butt here?
pick it up!
and why did you wear that color?
then what about you?
don't wear the same color as mine!
the heroine is tough, like the 'terminator'.
the year is 2137.
villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
i don't know why.
to save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
they have to kiss in the end.
this isn't a melodrama.
it's an action movie.
you don't know movies.
koreans like melodramas.
know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
shower by hwang sunwon.
it shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
koreans like sad movies all because of 'shower'.
what's sad about it?
it's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
i couldn't sleep for one week.
the ending sucks.
gotta change it.
it's sad.
her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
their family line is broken up now.
but you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
gyeonwoo's mother:
this was her last request.
when i die, please bury me with my loving friend.
gyeonwoo's mother:
to bury him alive, even.
oh, my gosh.
what's the matter?
 what's wrong?
no way!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!
bury him!
they bury him alive.
isn't it sad?
i must be hurt still.
i think i'll never get over him.
how deep could it be?
i don't know.
gyeonwoo, go in the water.
i wanna know how deep it is.
come on.
help me!
help me!
wow, it's deep.
i can't swim!
yes, it's deep
my mind was getting blurry.
at that moment
heard you got a girlfriend.
introduce me.
 i'm serious.
is she pretty?
have you kissed her?
gonna introduce me or not?
she really pretty?
what are you looking at?

she's my girlfriend from today.

it's so delicious.
you're very happy to see me, aren't you?
be good to me and you'll always be with good luck.
if i sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
if she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
if she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
when i'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
so i have to come at the right time.
you studying now?
yes, i'm.
i'm looking over something on the internet.
go to bed now. you too, dad.
all right, good night!
good night.
ok then, i'm gonna have a sleep too.
you're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
of course not, dad.
you don't trust me?
no, i do.
time for bed.
go to sleep. good night, dad.
hi, gyeonwoo.
my birthday's in two days.
you're dead if you forget.
got it?
since i like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * ¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬
got it?
i got it.
her birthday.
if i prepare nothing, she may murder me.
i have a good idea.
before going to the service, i worked in a theme park.
so this is my plan.
at midnight, i'll be alone with her in the park.
it'll be completely dark all around us.
one by one, the lights to the merrygoround flick on.
i raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
then all the lights turn on and it moves.
there's fireworks, too.
isn't it fantastic?
she'll be thrilled.
i gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
jump over here?
we have to.
i always wanted to come here at night.
it's my birthday, not yours.
please, let's just try.
i'll go up first and help you.
there's a step here.
take my hand.
answer me.
i'm leaving.
i'm leaving.
answer me!
you're dead.
wait till i catch you.
why didn't you answer?
wanna die?
come with me!
hurry and get in.
shut up!
go in fast.
move it.
sit here.
if you're loud, i'll kill you.
got it?
answer quietly!
 yes.
is that a real gun?
wanna see?
 forget it.
how are you two related?
we're just friends.
i'm not a cat or anything!
go ahead and apolize!
i'll do it.
i'm sorry.
anyway, friends come here late at night?
why are you here?
we just wanted to come here at night.
tell me the truth, idiot.  nothing special.
what makes you trust a guy like him?
i trusted myself.
i had a girlfriend, too.
she visited me every week for one year.
i was so happy.
i found out the fact after he was discharged.
while i'm in the service, even my dog ran away with some mutt, too.
my yorkshire terrier.
i have the worst luck in this world.
know what special day is it today?
this sucks!
hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
don't know.
heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
that's serious.
a teeny bullet does that?
yeah, the bullet tears the
what are you two doing?
stop joking around.
even you bastards ignore me.
that's why don't be foolish. why am i foolish?
even if you do this, she won't come back.
i know. i know, too.
but if i die, she'll be heartbroken.
she'll never be the same.
you're wrong.
the pain goes away sooner than you think.
you went through something like this?
it happens that way.
if i'm caught, i'll go to the can.
i'll always think of her there.
what does 'can' mean?
it means prison.
don't interrupt. sorry.
anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
excuse me, sir.
how about letting her go?
if i say no?
then let me go, instead.
come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
you act like him, too.
you can go.
and you
we die together.
got it?
hey, lady.
got it?
 let's go together.
all three of us.
will you leave if i kill him?
don't worry too much.
this soldier isn't a bad guy.
you'll come out safely.
you're leaving me alone?
there's no other way.
i was afraid to die alone, but i'm glad we're in it together.
oh, right.
over there, there's an exit near the merrygoround.
nobody knows about it.
i used to work here.
you're not tricking me, right?
i'm a man, too.
why would i?
walk in front of me.
i told you so.
this way!
what's going on?
it's gyeonwoo.
screw you!
don't come closer!
i'll kill him!
i'll really kill him!
so she can see me die!
i'll give you an hour!
if not, i'll kill him, and myself, too!
got it?
hurry up!
sniper 2!
the hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
don't shoot!
hey, soldier!
i mean sir!
your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
did you really love her?
ask yourself.
i think you didn't.
if you really love her, you should let her go.
if not, then it's not love.
what's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
a person like you should learn more about love.
if we want to learn, then we should keep living.
she's the nicest girl i've met.
don't let her go.
got it?
if you do, i'll take her.
can i go?
screw it.
don't know.
thank you.
today's my birthday.
i'll live on until i learn what love is.
we're just friends?
no, i said that to save you.
let me go, instead?
wanted to save yourself, huh?
he wouldn't have let you go.
stop lying!
stop lying!
stop lying!
have a nice life alone.
i screwed up her birthday, but i feel good anyway.
'cause i'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
i hope you believe in me.
you can't?
second half
i remember.
she always came with him until last year.
was it last spring or winter?
one day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
to not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
what's up?
oh, hi.
you're early.
i was in the neighborhood.
miss me?
of course!
she always tried hard to look cheery.
i like her that way. what would you like?
coke, please.
wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees, please.
he he he
i know her.
she pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
what are you doing?
what are you smiling at?
it's nothing.
looks fun, huh?
another one?
don't wanna read it?
she may get disappointed, but i should be honest for her sake.
looks fun.
i'll read it.
this time it's a martial arts film.
the heroine is a bounty hunter.
the villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
the worst of his kind.
what happened?
his name's gyeonwoo?
the story's setting is a mess.
japan invades during king sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant yeonsan.
in the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
the heroine becomes a king.
king jungjo.
she's from the future, of course.
it's fun, huh?
why is the heroine always from the future?
science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
and people go to the past to travel.
people from the future could be here now.
i think ufos are time machines.
someday, i'll meet someone from the future.
i have to.
if you do, ask him to take you.
if it's possible
give this to shin cine.
tell them to cast han sukgyu and shim eunha.
jeon doyun is okay, too.
excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
well this is 'the warrior's sad love story'
it's going to be a hit.
shin cine didn't call back.
hey, kid.
is the subway your sketch book?
don't scribble on it.
wanna die?
my lipstick!
i always take her home, even to bupyung station.
it's something a man must do.
on the way, we play fun games, too.
left foot over the line, i win.
with the right foot, you win.
what's the prize?
let's see
how about a kiss?
a kiss?
wanna die?
you choose.
hitting each other.
you can hit me, too.
someone's coming.
i think this is unfair.
i'm a girl, so i'ii slap the cheek.
then i'ii change it, too.
but i'm a girl. men and women are equal.
okay, then.
you slap, and i slap, too.
go easy on me, and i'ii kill you.
better slap me on the cheek.
if you don't, i'ii kill you!
aii right.
you slap, and i'ii use my finger.
right, that's fair.
saw that?
see that guy step over with his left foot?
i had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
i thought it was this way.
shut up.
here they come.
left foot.
left foot.
it'ii be the right foot.
switch to the right.
you have to hit me?
you know why the sky is blue?
'cause the reflection of the sunshine.
it's for me!
i want it to be blue.
so, it's blue.
you know why the fire is hot?
it's all for me.
i want it to be hot.
so it is.
you know why we have four seasons here in korea.
because of you. that's correct!
and why you were born here?
it's for me as well. what?
that's nonsense.
i was born before you.
you know the word of 'worship'?
'peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of jesus.' huh?
yeah, i know.
so, get ready!
come here.
stay still.
when i'm with her,
i never know how the day will turn out.
what are you looking at?
i quit!
is your face a racket?
why does the ball always hit my face?
it's strange.
i never want to lose a game.
so i play until i win.
wait long?
just a teeny bit.
my mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
want a massage?
no, it's okay.
instead, iet's exchange shoes.
don't wanna?
how can a guy wear heels?
it'ii fit.
but, i can't
i see.
come on.
i'ii buy you some sneakers.
forget it.
then wear mine, and i'ii carry yours.
you don't understand women.
let's exchange.
wanna know a secret?
what is it?
but i had one today.
catch me, honey!
if you don't, i'ii kill you.
phew catch me, honey!
stop right there!
it was just a second, but i felt something in her eyes.
that's my house.
i'ii bring you an umbrella.
i'm okay.
i'm already wet so i'ii just leave.
are you my daughter's boyfriend?
yes, sir.
how much do you know about my daughter?
not much
next time, don't hang out till late.
you don't understand me.
why'd you stand him up?
what's wrong with him?
why do you stand guys up?
and what happened to your heels?
what's wrong with you?
i told you not to meet gyeonwoo.
he's dumb and has no future.
it's none of your business.
why is he stupid?
you're stupid so you don't know.
what has gotten in to you?
let me live my own life!
i didn't hear from her for a iong time.
 gyeonwoo, it's me.
long time no see.
her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
our 100th day celebration is soon.
it's 100 days already?
when do you think a girl's the prettiest?
when a sexy woman is naked.
where are you now?
stay right there.
no, i'm just kidding.
the prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
what's your favorite song?
that george winston song.
pacheibei canon?
yeah, that song.
you're not gonna ask me?
when is the guy the prettiest?
just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
do it yourself, okay?
what did you say?
how can i during class?
just hung up on me!
i don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
oh my god!
a burglar!
help, a burglar!
are you crazy?
you're gonna break into where?
what on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
and you
why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going bupyung for the girl.
you never know how much hard time i went through for you.
she even intends to introduce a girl to you.
where are you going?
i'm cleverer than i iook.
these girls sure love chinese food.
hey, you!
where you headed?
come here!
i'm delivering chinese food.
i ordered it.
bring it here.
bring a iot of radish?
oh, i forgot something!
give me the food first!
that's the wrong way!
there's another customer.
but that wasn't enough for her.
we relived our old high school days.
drink till die!
i've never had anything like this.
sorry, i'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
have a smoke, too!
wow, i've never had a smoke, either!
gonna be a big deal.
i don't smoke well
what are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
it's a suspension!
you've already had your ups and downs in life.
not to worry.
go ahead and smoke!
hey, you are such a tough cookie!
you go to a very good school!
these clothes are so tight!
after we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
but she got wasted again.
oh, wild teens!
here's a condom.
let's prevent aids.
she's having a happy dream.
compared to when i looked at her in the motel the first time,
she looks so different.
could her pain be cured now?
maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
excuse me.
can you drive slowly?
have any plans after graduation?
actually, i've never thought about it yet.
can i see what's in your pocket?
it's a condom.
what is this for?
oh, right.
i learned that it prevents aids.
but i haven't used it yet.
actually, on the way here.  forget it.
'chicks hen'?
what does this mean?
oh, right.
it's a chicken soup restaurant.
'we'll satisfy all your wishes?
i think it's to satisfy our tastes.
'hurry and tell him.'
how do feel about our daughter?
oh, right.
we're just friends now.
please don't worry.
if we get closer, i'll let you know, sir.
don't see her any more.
after that day, she never calls me.
it was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
we've broken up.
now, i'm free.
it's me.
come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
i have a blind date today.
come in 45 minutes.
i have a blind date, too.
are you on your way?
i'm on a date with a girl.
hurry up.
i have to go to the bathroom.
'gotta go to the bathroom.'
nice to meet you.
i'm cha seokwon.
nice to meet you.
same here.  have a seat.
were you really with a girl?
no, i was with a guy.
can i take your order?
coffee, please.
you can drink coke.
i'll drink coffee.
you're very lucky.
i heard a lot about you.
that you're a close friend.
i need to go to the bathroom.
how is he?
no idea but he looks nice.
he is not the man you broke up with, is he?
how do you know?
when you see a new man
forget about the past, all right?
how the hell do you know?
this necklace is given from your exboyfriend, isn't it?
you wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
considering your temper and you used to say that you couldn't get over him.
does that means he isn't here anymore in this world.
that man is the one my mom introduced to me.
she kept pushing me to meet him doesn't look bad, does he?
hey, listen!
i'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
man likes something more feminine.
and don't drink a lot.
some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
and it's all right with me, but to the other guys try to surrender for just once.
 not try to win.
good luck to you.
where's gyeonwoo?
he left already.
he told me ten rules to follow.
i have a good memory.
i'll recite them.
first, don't ask her to be feminine.
and don't
second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
she'll beat someone.
at a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
if she hits you, act like it hurts.
if it hurts, act like it doesn't.
on your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
she'll like it a lot.
make sure you learn fencing and squash.
also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
if she says she'll kill you, don't take it lightly.
you'll feel better.
if her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
finally, she likes to write.
encourage her.
ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention
step back behind the yellow line
after passengers getting off, take in order
please use the next train.
what's his name?
i'll do it myself.
where are you?
i looked all over for you.
come to the escalator.
you're dead if you don't.
hurry up.
who told you to hug me?
you're supposed to dodge.
sometimes i feel like i know her and sometimes i don't.
we're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
what's going on between us?
can this relationship last forever?
who is it?
it's me, dad.
she told me to write a letter and bring it.
to write it on paper.
to express my feelings,
i tried hard to find the right words.
when i first met her,
i wanted to cure her grief, but now i can't give her up.
i wish we can get serious.
i'm writing about these feelings.
she's probably writing about me now.
this is how we're preparing to split up.
see that mountain top?
could someone hear me from there?
yes, probably so.
or probably not.
then go over there.
i'll shout here.
if you hear, answer me.
you want me to go over there?
can you hear me?
i'm sorry.
i really can't help it.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry
i can't help it.
i thought i was different, but i'm just a helpless girl.
i'm sorry.
did you bring your letter?
what's that?
a time capsule.
we put our letters in it and bury it here.
and two years later, let's meet here again.
we'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
this was her way of saying goodbye, and i kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
we can meet two years later.
when we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
we may become closer, or stay forever apart.
we can only choose one.
you go first.
let's separate here.
should we go together?
no, i'll take the next train.
i think that's better.
see you two years later!
okay, in two years!
two years!
that's how we broke up.
over time
i couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
thinking of those memories,
i started to write about our stories on the internet.
then i made up my mind.
if i meet her again, i'll show her a different me.
got to make use of my time.
for her and my future's sake.
why does the ball i hit keep hitting my face?
i wrote our stories on the internet everyday, and i kept myself busy for two years.
excuse me.
i wrote 'my sassy girl'.
shin cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
i made her dream come true instead.
i wanted to tell her right away, but i can only wait till that day.
she didn't come.
it's our only day to meet.
no one knows when she will come.
how did he get in here?
it's a mystery.
how are you?
i was so happy while being with you.
i'm not sure if you knew, but the person i loved passed away.
the day when i first met you was the day he died a year ago.
actually, i tried to look for him in you.
i know it was wrong.
i'm sorry.
i also met him on the subway like you.
i was really sick at that time.
he did everything i wanted.
like you did to me.
under this tree, we planned our future together.
but he suddenly passed away.
while i was dating you, i met his mother often.
she wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but i couldn't.
the day i first met you, i came under this tree, and i prayed to him.
to let me free.
when i met you, this occurred to me.
that maybe he introduced you to me.
but the more i met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
the more i liked you, i felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
i want to forget him alone.
after that day, i went often to this place.
if i'm not with you after two years, it means i still lack of courage.
how much will we change after two years?
i feel like you live in the future, and i stay in the past.
i want to meet you soon, so i can read your letter.
why are you staring at me, sir?
because you're so pretty.
i thought an angel came down.
do you come here often?
this tree has a secret.
i have a secret here, too.
three years ago, i buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
what's your secret?
so what happened?
we promised to read the letters a year ago.
but i couldn't come.
i guess you're a year late.
but two years didn't seem that long.
i haven't made any decision yet.
i just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
like what?
if we were destined to meet,
i thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
know what fate is?
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
to be honest, i read you guys letters.
i said this tree had a secret, right?
look closely.
does this tree look the same as before?
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
but i'm not sure.
people are dead or alive.
there's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
this tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
it was split into two.
but this young man felt sorry for it.
during this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
when he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
he said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
(time machine flying away)
you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.

i was getting my photo taken.
you naughty boy.

sorry i didn't tell you before.
this is gyeonwoo.
doesn't he resemble him?
when you had a hard time,
i tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
heard you came to bupyung often, but you never visited me?
go out with him.
i thought he'd make things easy for you.
oh, yeah.
gyeonwoo, you're going to england, right?
she's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
i don't have to go now.
you two know each other?
you may not believe it, but i think i met an old man from the future.
from your future.

think it's too coincidental?
it's building a bridge of chance for your love.

that's right.
i kind of remember that.
you showered to wash off vomit and sweat,
girl:and the police came?
that's right.

koreans like meiodramas.

it's sad when she asked
gyeonwoo:to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
i couldn't sleep for one week.
the ending sucks.

their family line is broken up now.
gyeonwoo's father:
but you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
gyeonwoo's mom:
gyeonwoo's father:
this was her last request.
gyeonwoo's father:
when i die, please bury me with my loving friend.
gyeonwoo's mom:(surprised) what?
gyeonwoo's father:
to bury him alive, even.
gyeonwoo's mom:
oh, my gosh.
gyeonwoo's father:
what's the matter?
gyeonwoo's mom:
what's wrong?
no way!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!
this is wrong!

they bury him alive.
isn't it sad?
girl:(in a sad voice) i must be hurt still.
i think i'ii never get over him.

you're very happy to see me, aren't you?
be good to me
girl:and you'ii always be with good luck.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) if i sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hands.
if she's sweeping, it's a broom stick.
if she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
when i'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
so i have to come at the right time.
(the sound of fulling cloth)
gyeonwoo's father:
you studying now?
yes, i'm.
i'm looking over something on the internet.
gyeonwoo's father:

since i like you so much, better make me smile like this. *________*
got it?
i got it.
gyeonwoo:(sigh) phew
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) her birthday.
if i prepare nothing, she may murder me.
i have a good idea.
before going to the service, i worked in a theme park.
so this is my plan.
at midnight, i'ii be alone with her in the park.
it'ii be completely dark all around us.
one by one, the lights to the merrygoround flick on.
i raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
then all the lights turn on and it moves.
there's fireworks, too.
isn't it fantastic?
she'ii be thrilled.
i gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
jump over here?
we have to.
i always wanted to come here at night.
it's my birthday, not yours.
please, iet's just try.
i'ii go up first and help you.
there's a step here.
take my hand.
(tumbiing down)
(surprised at a deserter)
answer me.
i'm leaving.
i'm leaving.
answer me!
you're dead.
wait till i catch you.
why didn't you answer?
wanna die?
come with me!
(the sound of car passing by)
hurry and get in.
(gyeonwoo screaming)
shut up!
go in fast.
move it.
sit here.
if you're loud, i'ii kill you.
got it?
gyeonwoo:(sobbing) yes.
answer quietly!
gyeonwoo:(quietly) yes.
(gyeonwoo startled at her)
is that a real gun?
wanna see?
forget it.
how are you two related?
we're just friends.
i'm not a cat or anything!
go ahead and apologize!
i'ii do it.
i'm sorry.
anyway, friends come here late at night?
why are you here?
gyeonwoo:(stammering) we just wanted to come here at night.
tell me the truth, idiot.
nothing special.
what makes you trust a guy like him?
i trusted myself.
deserter:(sigh) i had a girlfriend, too.
she visited me every week for one year.
i was so happy.
i found out the fact after he was discharged.
while i'm in the service, even my dog
deserter:ran away with some mutt, too.
my yorkshire terrier.
i have the worst luck in this world.
know what special day is it today?
this sucks!
(a deserter screaming)
(as if feeling sick) uuuuuuuhhh ack!
hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
don't know.
heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
that's serious.
a teeny bullet does that?
yeah, the bullet tears the
what are you two doing?
stop joking around.
even you bastards ignore me.
that's why don't be foolish.
why am i foolish?
even if you do this, she won't come back.
i know.
i know, too.
but if i die, she'ii be heartbroken.
she'ii never be the same.
you're wrong.
the pain goes away sooner than you think.
you went through something like this?
it happens that way.
if i'm caught, i'ii go to the can.
i'ii always think of her there.
what does 'can' mean?
it means prison.
don't interrupt.
anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
excuse me, sir.
how about letting her go?
if i say no?
let me go, instead.
come to think of it,
deserter:your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
you act like him, too.
you can go.
and you
we die together.
got it?
hey, lady.
got it?
let's go together.
aii three of us.
will you leave if i kill him?
don't worry too much.
this soldier isn't a bad guy.
you'ii come out safely.
gyeonwoo:(sobbing) you're leaving me alone?
there's no other way.
i was afraid to die alone, but i'm glad we're in it together.
(the sound of radio signal)
oh, right.
over there,
gyeonwoo:there's an exit near the merrygoround.
nobody knows about it.
i used to work here.
you're not tricking me, right?
i'm a man, too.
why would i?
walk in front of me.
i told you so.
(the radio signal)
soldier 1 :
this way!
(gyeonwoo screaming and running away)
friend 1 :
what's going on?
it's gyeonwoo.
screw you!
don't come closer!
i'ii kill him!
i'ii really kill him!
(a deserter shooting in the air)
so she can see me die!
i'ii give you an hour!
if not, i'ii kill him, and myself, too!
got it?
hurry up!
sniper 2!
the hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
don't shoot!
(the radio signal still going on)
hey, soldier!
i mean sir!
your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
did you really love her?
ask yourself.
i think you didn't.
if you really love her,
girl:you should let her go.
if not, then it's not love.
what's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
stop this,
girl:and go back to base as a real man.
a person like you should learn more about love.
girl:(crying) if we want to iearn,
girl:then we should keep living.
she's the nicest girl i've met.
don't let her go.
got it?
if you do, i'ii take her.
can i go?
screw it.
friend 1 :
don't know.
(fireworking) pop!
thank you.
today's my birthday.
i'ii live on until i learn what love is.
we're just friends?
no, i said that to save you.
let me go, instead?
wanted to save yourself, huh?
he wouldn't have let you go.
stop lying!
stop lying!
stop lying!
have a nice life alone.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) i screwed up her birthday, but i feel good anyway.
'cause i'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
i hope you believe in me.
you can't?
second half
i remember.
she always came with him until last year.
was it last spring or autumn?
one day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
to not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
what's up?
oh, hi.
you're early.
i was in the neighborhood.
miss me?
of course!
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) she always tried hard to look cheerful.
i iike her that way.
what would you iike?
coke, please.
wanna die?
drink coffee.
two coffees, please.
(gyeonwoo grinning) he he he
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) i know her.
she pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
what are you doing?
what are you smiling at?
it's nothing.
looks fun, huh?
another one?
don't wanna read it?
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) she may get disappointed,
gyeonwoo:but i should be honest for her sake.
looks fun.
i'ii read it.
(girl laughing brightly) ha ha ha
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) this time it's a martial art film.
the heroine is a bounty hunter.
the villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
the worst of his kind.
(people around a montage in commotion)
man 1 :
what happened?
his name's gyeonwoo?
man 2:
the story's setting is a mess.
japan invades during king sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant yeonsan.
in the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
(cunningiy laugh) he he he
(gyeonwoo screaming and running for her) yaaaah
(girl drawing a sword) yup!
the heroine becomes a king.
king jungjo.
she's from the future, of course.
it's fun, huh?
why is the heroine always from the future?
science is advanced then,
girl:so they invent a time machine.
and people go to the past to travel.
people from the future could be here now.
i think ufos are time machines.
someday, i'ii meet someone from the future.
i have to.
if you do, ask him to take you.
if it's possible
give this to shin cine.
tell them to cast han sukgyu and shim eunha.
jeon doyun is okay, too.
excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
well this is 'the warrior's sad love story'
(man feeling like vomiting) uuuuuuuugh
(man throwing up) uuuh aaaack!
it's going to be a hit.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) shin cine didn't call back.
hey, kid.
is the subway your sketch book?
don't scribble on it.
wanna die?
my lipstick!
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) i always take her home, even to bupyung station.
it's something a man must do.
on the way, we play fun games, too.
left foot over the line, i win.
with the right foot, you win.
what's the prize?
let's see
how about a kiss?
girl:(in a loud voice) a kiss?
wanna die?
you choose.
hitting each other.
you can hit me, too.
someone's coming.
(gyeonwoo laughing) ha ha ha!
i think this is unfair.
i'm a girl, so i'ii slap the cheek.
then i'ii change it, too.
but i'm a girl.
men and women are equal.
okay, then.
you slap, and i slap, too.
go easy on me, and i'ii kill you.
better slap me on the cheek.
if you don't, i'ii kill you!
aii right.
you slap, and i'ii use my finger.
right, that's fair.
saw that?
see that guy step over with his left foot?
i had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
i thought it was this way.
shut up.
here they come.
a staff sergeant:
left foot.
left foot.
it'ii be the right foot.
a staff sergeant:
switch to the right.
you have to hit me?
you know why the sky is blue?
gyeonwoo:'cause the reflection of the sunshine.
it's for me!
i want it to be blue.
so, it's blue.
you know why the fire is hot?
it's all for me.
i want it to be hot.
so it is.
you know why we have four seasons here in korea.
because of you.
that's correct!
and why you were born here?
it's for me as well.
that's nonsense.
i was born before you.
you know the word of 'worship'?
girl:'peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of jesus.' huh?
yeah, i know.
so, get ready!
come here.
stay still.
uh uh uh!
(passengers surprised)
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) when i'm with her,
i never know how the day will turn out.
what are you looking at?
i quit!
is your face a racket?
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) why does the ball always hit my face?
it's strange.
(gyeonwoo screaming) ugh!
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) i never want to lose a game.
so i play until i win.
(gyeonwoo screaming and running) aaaaaaaaah!
(gyeonwoo groaning) ugh!
wait long?
just a teeny bit.
my mom bought me these heels,
girl:but they're killing my feet.
want a massage?
no, it's okay.
instead, iet's exchange shoes.
don't wanna?
how can a guy wear heels?
it'ii fit.
but, i can't
i see.
come on.
i'ii buy you some sneakers.
forget it.
then wear mine, and i'ii carry yours.
you don't understand women.
let's exchange.
wanna know a secret?
what is it?
but i had one today.
catch me, honey!
if you don't, i'ii kill you.
phew girl:
catch me, honey!
stop right there!
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) it was just a second, but i felt something in her eyes.
that's my house.
i'ii bring you an umbrella.
i'm okay.
i'm already wet so i'ii just leave.
girl's father:
are you my daughter's boyfriend?
yes, sir.
girl's father:
how much do you know about my daughter?
not much
girl's father:
next time, don't hang out till late.
girl's mom:
you don't understand me.
girl's mom:
why'd you stand him up?
girl's mom:
what's wrong with him?
why do you stand guys up?
girl's mom:
and what happened to your heels?
girl's mom:
what's wrong with you?
girl's mom:
i told you not to meet gyeonwoo.
girl's mom:
he's dumb and has no future.
it's none of your business.
why is he stupid?
you're stupid so you don't know.
girl's mom:
what has gotten in to you?
let me live my own life!
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) afterwards,
i didn't hear from her for a iong time.
(cellular phone ringing)
gyeonwoo, it's me.
long time no see.
her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
our 100th day celebration is soon.
it's 100 days already?
when do you think a girl's the prettiest?
when a sexy woman is naked.
where are you now?
stay right there.
no, i'm just kidding.
the prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
what's your favorite song?
that george winston song.
(gyeonwoo humming) ta ia ia ia ia ia ta ia
pacheibei's 'canon'?
yeah, that song.
you're not gonna ask me?
when is the guy the prettiest?
just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
bring it on our 100th day,
girl:and give me a rose during my class.
do it yourself, okay?
what did you say?
how can i during class?
just hung up on me!
(students shouting to be quiet)
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) i don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
gyeonwoo's mom:
oh my god!
a burglar!
gyeonwoo's mom:
help, a burglar!
gyeonwoo's mom:
are you crazy?
you're gonna break into where?
gyeonwoo's mom:
what on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
gyeonwoo's mom:
and you
gyeonwoo's mom:
why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going bupyung for the girl.
gyeonwoo's mom:
you never know how much hard time i went through for you.
gyeonwoo's mom:
she even intends to introduce a girl to you.
gyeonwoo's mom:
where are you going?
i'm cleverer than i iook.
these girls sure love chinese food.
hey, you!
where you headed?
come here!
i'm delivering chinese food.
i ordered it.
bring it here.
bring a iot of radish?
oh, i forgot something!
give me the food first!
that's the wrong way!
there's another customer.
(classroom in commotion) (becoming as silent as death)
(again in commotion)
(pacheibei's 'canon' begins to be played)
(students clapping and shouting)
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) but that wasn't enough for her.
we relived our old high school days.
drink till die!
i've never had anything like this.
sorry, i'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
have a smoke, too!
wow, i've never had a smoke, either!
gonna be a big deal.
i don't smoke well
what are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
it's a suspension!
you've already had your ups and downs in life.
go ahead and smoke!
hey, you are such a tough cookie!
you go to very good school!
not to worry.
this clothes is so tight!
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) after we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
but she got wasted again.
condom man:
oh, wild teens!
here's a condom.
condom man:
let's prevent aids.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) she's having a happy dream.
compared to when i iooked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
could her pain be cured now?
maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
excuse me.
can you drive slowly?
girl's father:
girl's father:
have any plans after graduation?
actually, i've never thought about it yet.
girl's father:
can i see what's in your pocket?
(girl's mom mumbling without sound) 'it's a condom.'
girl's father:
what is this for?
oh, right.
i iearned that it prevents aids.
but i haven't used it yet.
actually, on the way here.
girl's father:
forget it.
girl's father:'chicks hen'?
what does this mean?
oh, right.
it's a chicken soup restaurant.
girl's father:'we'ii satisfy all your wishes?
i think it's to satisfy our tastes.
girl's mom:(without sound) 'hurry and tell him.'
girl's father:
how do feel about our daughter?
oh, right.
we're just friends now.
please don't worry.
if we get closer, i'ii let you know, sir.
girl's father:
don't see her any more.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) after that day, she never calls me.
it was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
we're broken up.
now, i'm free.
(cellular phone ringing)
it's me.
come to the cafe by seven o'ciock.
i have a blind date today.
come in 45 minutes.
i have a blind date, too.
(gyeonwoo surprised)
(cellular phone ringing)
are you on your way?
i'm on a date with a girl.
hurry up.
i have to go to the bathroom.
gyeonwoo:'gotta go to the bathroom.'
gyeonwoo:(in amazement) eh?
(gyeonwoo sobbing as he feels mistreated)
nice to meet you.
i'm cha seokwon.
nice to meet you.
same here.
have a seat.
were you really with a girl?
no, i was with a guy.
can i take your order?
coffee, please.
you can drink coke.
i'ii drink coffee.
you're very lucky.
i heard a iot about you.
that you're close friend.
i need to go to the bathroom.
how is he?
no idea
but he looks nice.
he is not the man you broke up with, is he?
how do you know?
when you see a new man
gyeonwoo:forget about the past, all right?
how the hell do you know?
this necklace is given from your exboyfriend, isn't it?
you wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
considering your temper
and you
gyeonwoo:used to tell that you couldn't get over him.
does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world?
that man is the one my mom introduced me to meet.
she kept pushing me to meet him
doesn't look bad guy, does he?
hey, listen!
i'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
man likes something more feminine.
and don't drink a iot.
some of guys aim at the girls intoxicated.
and it's all right with me, but to the other guys
gyeonwoo:try to surrender for just once.
gyeonwoo: not try to win.
good luck to you.
where's gyeonwoo?
he left already.
he told me ten rules to follow.
i have a good memory.
i'ii recite them.
first, don't ask her to be feminine.
and don't
second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
she'ii beat someone.
at a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
if she hits you, act like it hurts.
if it hurts, act like it doesn't.
on your 100th day together,
gyeonwoo:give her a rose during her class.
she'ii like it a iot.
make sure you learn fencing and squash.
also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
if she says she'ii kill you,
gyeonwoo:don't take it lightly.
you'ii feel better.
if her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
finally, she likes to write.
encourage her.
(girl breathing hard)
(station attendant) ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention to here
station attendant:
step backward on the yellow line
station attendant: after passenger's getting off, take in order
station attendant:please use the next train.
station attendant:
what's his name?
i'ii do it myself.
where are you?
i iooked all over for you.
come to the escalator.
you're dead if you don't.
hurry up.
who told you to hug me?
(gyeonwoo screaming)
you're supposed to dodge.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) sometimes i feel like i know her and sometimes i don't.
we're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
what's going on between us?
can this relationship last forever?
(doorbeii ringing)
girl's father:
who is it?
it's me, dad.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) she told me to write a letter and bring it.
to write it on paper.
to express my feelings,
i tried hard to find the right words.
when i first met her,
i wanted to cure her grief, but now i can't give her up.
i wish we can get serious.
i'm writing about these feelings.
she's probably writing about me now.
this is how we're preparing to split up.
(bird twittering around)
see that mountain top?
could someone hear me from there?
yes, probably so.
or probably not.
then go over there.
i'ii shout here.
if you hear, answer me.
you want me to go over there?
can you hear me?
i'm sorry.
i really can't help it.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry
i can't help it.
i thought i was different, but i'm just a helpless girl.
i'm sorry.
did you bring your letter?
what's that?
a time capsule.
we put our letters in it and bury it here.
and two years later, iet's meet here again.
we'ii read the letters that day,
girl:and maybe we can find an answer then.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) this was her way of saying goodbye, and i kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) we can meet two years later.
when we meet then, we'ii be different from what we are now.
we may become closer, or stay forever apart.
we can only choose one.
you go first.
let's separate here.
should we go together?
no, i'ii take the next train.
i think that's better.
see you two years later!
okay, in two years!
two years!
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) that's how we broke up.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) i couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
thinking of those memories,
i started to write about our stories on the internet.
then i made up my mind.
if i meet her again, i'ii show her a different myself.
got to make use of my time.
for her and my future's sake.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) why does the ball i hit keep hitting my face?
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) i wrote our stories on the internet everyday, and i kept myself busy for two years.
(gulp gulp) (shouting) yup!
excuse me.
i wrote 'my sassy girl'.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) shin cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
i made her dream come true instead.
i wanted to tell her right away, but i can only wait till that day.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) she didn't come.
it's our only day to meet.
no one knows when she will come.
(gyeonwoo crying out in surprise) wow!
how did he get in here?
it's a mystery.
how are you?
i was so happy while being with you.
i'm not sure if you knew, but the person i ioved passed away.
the day when i first met you was the day he died a year ago.
actually, i tried to look for him in you.
i know it was wrong.
i'm sorry.
i also met him on the subway like you.
i was really sick at that time.
he did everything i wanted.
like you did to me.
under this tree, we planned our future together.
but he suddenly passed away.
while i was dating you, i met his mother often.
she wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but i couldn't.
the day i first met you, i came under this tree, and i prayed to him.
to let me free.
when i met you, this occurred to me.
that maybe
he introduced you to me.
but the more i met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
the more i liked you, i felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
i want to forget him alone.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) after that day, i went often to this place.
if i'm not with you after two years, it means i still lack of courage.
how much will we change after two years?
i feel like you live in the future, and i stay in the past.
i want to meet you soon, so i can read your letter.
why are you staring at me, sir?
old man:
because you're so pretty.
i thought an angel came down.
do you come here often?
old man:
this tree has a secret.
i have a secret here, too.
old man:
three years ago, i buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
what's your secret?
old man:
so what happened?
we promised to read the letters a year ago.
but i couldn't come.
old man:
i guess you're a year late.
but two years didn't seem that long.
i haven't made any decision yet.
i just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
old man:
like what?
if we were destined to meet,
i thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
old man:
know what fate is?
old man:
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
old man:
to be honest, i read you guys letters.
old man:
i said this tree had a secret, right?
old man:
look closely.
does this tree look the same as before?
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
but i'm not sure.
old man:
people are dead or alive.
old man:
there's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
old man:
this tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
old man:
it was split into two.
old man:
but this young man felt sorry for it.
old man:
during this spring,
old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
old man:
when he planted the tree,
old man:he asked me if it look the same.
old man:
he said that someone would be sad if it died,
old man:so no one should know.
(recorded mechanical voice) you call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
it's been a while.
you've gotten prettier.
you still look young.
how have you been?
you were in england?
for one and a half years.
so i can forget him.
i see.
feel better?
a iot better.
is it true now?
my son might be sad.
he won't.
he'ii like it this way.
good, that's what i really hoped.
i was getting my photo taken.
you naughty boy.
know how long it's been?
sorry i didn't tell you before.
this is gyeonwoo.
doesn't he resemble him?
when you had a hard time,
i tried to introduce you to him for several years,
auntie:but he kept getting out of it.
heard you came to bupyung often,
auntie:but you never visited me?
go out with him.
i thought he'd make things easy for you.
oh, yeah.
gyeonwoo, you're going to england, right?
she's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
i don't have to go now.
you two know each other?
you may not believe it, but i think i met a man from the future.
from your future.
gyeonwoo:(monoiog) this is how i met her again.
think it's too coincidental?
it's building a bridge of chance for your love.
patient has pneumothorax but is trapped under the panel
there are no doctors we can't perform aspiration
send the emergency unit here now
help me!
i can't perform aspiration, doctor!
bp 170100, pulse 100, sao270
i'll lose my license
i won't make it
i'm sorry
stay where you are!
you may lose your job, but remember you saved someone's life
breathing is steady, bp 17080 pulse 80, sao295
no hospital is like that!
dr. wong!
this place requires forms for everything
you're lucky to have dr. wong supervising you!
he's a good teacher
this is for first visit, this is for blood test and this is for xray
these two are the most important
claim forms for meal and transportation
the hospital has a liability system so write intelligibly then no one can sue you for malpractice
ho kau kei
yes, you're at the ho kau kei hospital
what happened to him?
got hit by lightning
what would you do, dr. ho?
take his blood pressure and sao2
check his optic nerve for any damage
check for facial palsy
most likely he won't make it
if he died in the a e, there is report to write and maybe a law suit to settle
we should send him away
you know where to?
dr. ma is on duty there
he's too busy watching horse races to treat anyone
orthopedics' dr. yau i can't get along so he's out
the only one left is the old maid at general medicine
i heard she's in love, been in good mood lately
she'll take the patient
take him away!
got hit by lightning at this age must've done some bad things
i've done good deeds!
i know you're a scum
no internal injury, surgery!
this is what a lightning victim look like
god will punish you for doing bad things
i've done good deeds!
stop explaining yourself!
forget it!
take him to orthopedics
why is he here if his bones are fine?
he was just there
then general medicine
he was there too
take him back to the a e
aren't you ashamed of shoving an old man to different departments?
how about that hemorrhoids patient
you sent here last time?
your department has openings you should treat everyone!
orthopedics is not a e's dumpster
you can't just send people up
my diagnosis comes from careful thinking and examination
i know what i'm doing
he has no fractures, not even a spondylitis
how about his bone density level?
why don't you say a fish bone got stuck in his throat?
time to leave!
leftover from the last shift push him aside
he looks familiar
every dying old man looks just like this
send him up
you're in the way, old fart!
it stinks!
he's burnt
old man, elevator maintenance, take a breather
i only did good deeds, nothing bad
it's okay, being struck by lightning is a natural phenomenon
when the atmosphere acquires sufficient electricity
a discharge of electricity will strike an object on the ground
those people have no sense
you're a good man
sorry, i'm just a new doctor
this is all i can do
next time i'll give you a room
this is the reality:
how many doctors are actually impartial and committed?
let's eat!
don't let go of your hands!
go on hitting me if you like, sir ho
i can take it
don't like your food?
order something else!
it's your treat anyway
when did he last eat?
call for help!
doesn't look like chest pain, could be asthma!
it's pouring outside!
his face is turning red, he's choking
he smells!
i can't get any closer
i've never smelled anything this bad
well done!
i feel itchy just by the brief contact
observe carefully, girl.
this is an example of medical ethics!
it's like a miracle!
what a pity!
he'll probably make it!
she's too busy for dinner
we'll have it wrapped to go
the food's cold, i'll get her another order
she barely touched her steak
maybe she'll like pork chop!
i'll get her hot coffee
with little sugar
are you okay, mister?
you all right?
he was choking.
had no pulse and heart beat
i performed cpr.
there's pulse now but very weak
so he's fine!
we won't take him then
i just had the car cleaned!
let me
get in
al, don't take him to ho kau kei!
you did good, i'm very pleased
i'm not, you're not fit to be a doctor
8 years ago, i came to the hospital for appendicitis
pretty girl, nice body too
if the scar doesn't allow her to wear bikinis ruins her chance to marry a good family her life will be meaningless!
she's 1, 5 ft. 1
should grow 3 more inches
proportionally the abdomen makes up 13 of the human body
if we cut 1 inch lower, her pants will hide the scar
but this raises the operation's difficulty
difficulty is not an issue
the patient's future is what counts
it's not easy to be a doctor!
it's not easy to be a doctor
i became a doctor because of what you said
but look at you now, look at your hair!
it's all greasy, what a mess!
and now you drive a volvo, afraid you may die?
i really miss you driving your gtr and your spiky hairdo
he's fired up!
that gets him going!
sir ho, someone attacked you?
who did?
i started the fight
those morons don't know better
the 7f management should go to hell!
they only wanted my money, not my suggestions
so i attacked them with shaolin kungfu!
they still tried to fight back
i knocked them down with the shadow kick
i beat them under the ground
i dare them to talk back at me
what are you doing?
plugging your tubes back
kid, don't move around when i'm talking to you
i want to reform the hospital but there's no one to trust
i believe in you.
you're the answer!
i can't, i'm new here
i'm ninetysomething and you won't help me where's your compassion?
i'd love to help but i can't change the system myself
okay, who do you have in mind?
say it, i'll write it down
nothing at this moment
say it
where are you going?
i think i've got the answer!
who is it?
who made this mess?
accident at a construction site
fracture in the left thigh, multiple lacerations
conscious index 10, bp 1050
pulse 110 1, 2, 3
cross match, cbp, ecg, sao2
everything ready
hypodermoclysis, units of unmatched blood
blood plasma full rate, check for any internal bleeding
i need a hand!
a shot of ampoules, defibrillator!
i had it, it was all right
did you watch tv last night?
the show was so lame!
give me a coffee
any sugar?
a little
listen to the radio now
it's hard to be a good doctor in this hospital!
i need a hand!
it's alcohol!
should we go find him?
rescue center
emergency checkup
supersonic welding
give me a 23
brake fluid 200cc, engine oil liters
battery water 0cc accumulator plate 10cc
start the engine!
how is it coming?
i welded back the chassis
how many more years can the car go?
the parts i repaired should give you another 10 years
thank you!
we'll go in and take a look
it's different this time
think about it, we've got sir ho
i won't go back
don't be so cold, help me out here!
prepare the rescue center
just this once!
if this is the way you are, i'll stay here until you say yes!
fine, see how long you'll last
don't leave me here
damage all over.
rocker arm is wasted so is the ball bearing the suspension
get me a screw, and remove the connecting rod
it hurts
your determination can't last 3 minutes
we've been friends for so long, let it go
i really made up my mind, trust me!
you never follow through with anything in your life
we gave our resignation when the hospital demanded reform
but you handed in a christmas card!
stay there!
8 years ago, i came to the hospital for appendicitis
pretty girl, good body
if the scar doesn't allow her to wear bikinis and ruins her chance to marry a good family
her life will be meaningless1
she's 1, 5ft, 1
should grow 3 more inches
proportionally the abdomen makes of 13 of the human body
if we cut one inch lower, her pants can hide the scar
but the operation will be more difficult!
difficulty is not the issue
what matters is the patient's future!
remember, it's not easy to be a doctor!
it's not easy to be a doctor
i became a doctor because of what you said
that's not what you told me
a good doctor like you repairing cars?
you have to fix my car it belongs to my boss
i like saving cars more than saving lives
what happened?
you may fool others, but you can't fool yourself
this place looks just like an a e
so where is your heart at?
air compression 0%, get me a pump and a drill
you will come back!
you have to help me out
you said last time i was the reason you became a doctor
back there you said it was because of joe
so who really inspired you?
it's not important who inspired me
what matters is who i will marry
what are you talking about?
don't laugh at what i'm about to say
i can't promise how i will react
that time when i underwent the operation
i had a crush on you guys and wanted to marry you
but i can't be married to two guys at once
so i decided to marry whoever that said it's not easy to be a doctor
don't laugh, i'm serious!
but i was drugged at the time, feeling unconscious couldn't figure out who said the words
good, everyone's here
i hope you can tell me what you think
say something!
you first, benz
you know the answer already
are you for it, mitsubishi?
the girl made some good points
she's hot!
don't go!
don't be like that!
stop crying!
you can't just go and leave us here
you're crazy!
calm down!
golf, we can't be selfish
this is a garage after all
joe has been a doctor all his life!
go back, joe
someone attacked you again?
who did?
no good!
i started the fight!
the management bastards on the 7th floor said i can't hire people, won't let me sign you
so i attacked them using the mantis stance
i fought very hard to get this
kid, you're sitting on my tube
i'm ninetysomething and you won't help me?
where's your compassion?
won't be easy to change things
there's andy, leon and the gang
plus the management rats are spying on us
those rats again?
i'll talk care of them!
okay, but you have to promise me don't die on us before we succeed
after being struck by lightning last month at the peak
philanthropist sir ho was found at the same place this morning
he was burnt and his condition was critical
police believes that sir ho returned to the peak for kungfu training
when lightning hit him again
this is worse than last time!
sir ho
poor old man got stuck by lightning twice
he probably won't wake up again
maybe we should
this is sir ho's last wish
we have to fulfill it for him!
we can't win the fight without his support
sir ho is ninetysomething and you won't help him?
where's your compassion?
sir ho manages to stay alive
he kept his promise, and so should we!
thwart their plan
they're really sneaky!
his face is pale, must be anemic
i heard they haven't left the room for years
what a pity, working in dark could result in amblyopia
sorry, sorry!
besides triage if the a e can help any patient, we'll do it ourselves
every shift is 8 hours, you can't be late
good morning!
what are we discussing now?
being ontime!
no unexcused absence
we have to go now, bye!
have a good time
you have one hour to eat
no food is allowed while you're on duty
i ordered it!
over here please!
i'm starving
no phone calls during operation
i'm busy now listening to nonsense
i'll call you from the or later
meeting adjourned
hold there!
you are new here, so listen carefully:
use the first urinal to finish business, not the other ones
cleaning all of them is too much work, trying to kill me?
you clean up your own spots!
meeting adjourned!
you call this a hospital?
doctors don't save lives
cleaning ladies don't clean
that's not all
maintenance guys don't maintain appliances
pharmacists don't fill prescriptions filing assistants don't file papers
that's not the worse!
canteen serves cold coffee soda machine dispenses warm drinks
we'll do it ourselves!
does it work?
the stock you
recommended lost all values
don't worry, the owner is my friend
he said to hold on to them
how is it, doctor?
sorry, we did everything we can
don't cry
we'll try again, let's go!
take it away!
it can't be done
how can you revive the dead?
i just unplugged the instruments
no breathing, no heartbeat
i'll do it
by the order of the highest management 3 doctors can't work on one patient at once
this is against cost effectiveness
be aware
be aware
terrible, more ribs are cracked
he should let the guy rest in peace
yeah but an important reminder:
according to the service agreement 300!
every patient gets 5 minutes of resuscitation procedure
you've exceeded the time hundreds of patients will be affected
this is a bbq.
i can smell the char
the mortician will have a hard time touching up the body
one unit of type o negative is $200
one injection is $1000
every pack of cotton balls is $30
more cotton
he really won't give up until the corpse is destroyed
he should at least show respect for the family
in order to balance the earnings and expenses we'll either fire medical staff or reduce medical supplies
overbudget, overtime, overbudget, overtime
we've got pulse!
put him on dopamine
doctor, it's okay
are you done?
hurry up!
we've got patients waiting!
how's my son, doctor?
he's got heartbeat we're taking him to the or
i love you!
i saved you because it's what i do it doesn't mean i love you
why not?
i don't like beggars
a rival!
did yan say who she's going to marry?
what are you talking about?
she made a vow, if you said it she'll marry you if i said it she'll marry me
she'll marry me if i said it, and will marry you if you said it
she'll marry you if i said it, and marry me if you said it
she'll marry you if i said it, and marry me if you said it
you have it all wrong.
like i said
she'll marry whoever said it
that's right
said what?
it's not easy to be a doctor
you remember who said it?
either you or i
good memory
of course
what are you doing?
every doctor has a kind heart it's the system that corrupted them
i'll remind them who they really are!
setting an example by doing everything
will that include many meaningless chores?
the more meaningless the better!
go for it
go for it
the manual
not in chinese?
go for it
go for it
go for it
go for it
3 hours left until the next shift, let's get some rest
get up!
get up!

as usual, there's no one here
i have to go to the bathroom
you're always like this

you think we can change them?
someone plans to jump off of the building!
how can this happen?
they responded!
i love you!
i found a job, i'm no longer a beggar
i don't date parttime construction worker
it's a fulltime job!
i don't like someone uneducated
buddy, don't jump!
what are you doing?

i've nothing to do with this!
what's wrong with you?
you hit my car!
calm down
don't come closer!
tell me your problem
too late!
i came here for appendectomy, but had my sperm duct removed
then a bad blood transfusion destroyed my liver
during liver transplant bad oxygen destroyed my lung years later and my duodenum is still not removed instead my body is all messed up
my boss fired me, my wife left me
my existence is meaningless!
my death will bring attention to this hospital's negligence
no, nobody will care
look, they're busy getting their cars out of the way
give us a little time
we are trying to make changes
this place will turn into a caring and responsible hospital
pay up!
you can't checkout without paying
i'm about to jump!
that's the same as checkingout, pay up
i have no money
stop making excuses
you hit my car, i want $30,000 for the damages
$30,000, are you kidding?
you switched lane without signaling
a guy jumped down, what can i do?
pay for the damages!
cross match, cbp, fullbodied xray!
saline full rate, uncross match units!
get a drill, and diathermy
what color do you want?
a e doesn't have these supplies you need to apply
yellow is for onemonth approval
red is for oneweek approval
blue is for nextday approval
when do you need the supplies?
right now!
then it's the green one, but it ran out
you can submit a white form to administration or a black one to the highest management
bring it back to the 2nd floor!
sterilize them
life comes first, hurry!
can they revive him?
hope god answers our prayer
still no response
8:50, certify!
what's that thing attached to the liver?
the duodenum's got something too!
isn't that leon's mobile?

someone didn't wear his mask

i just paid off the mortgage on my car!
this belongs to the deceased tell the doctors that operated on him to pick up their things
let's see what he's got. $1.5
don't jump to death if you had no money
why couldn't you do it from a cliff?
you hit my car!

what are they doing?
fixing our cars, i think
they are pretty decent people
don't rush to judgement, see if they can fix our cars first
they are admirable we look insignificant in comparison
andy, you can't make comparison like that
there are halos above them
no way
it's just reflection, you're ignorant
that's true
if good people have halos then should bad people have horns?
that's rubbish!
i love you!

cleopatra loved them.
cassanova lived for them.
the quest for the ultimate aphrodisiac is as old as the human race itself.
some search for nature's answer others concoct the perfect pill

don't buy it?
watch as we try it.
magic or medicine?"
stephen schneider, known to his friends as schnitzy is a writer living in new york city.
at 49, he feels he is running against time.
i was seeing this great girl a ballroom dance instructor named jamie, she taught me to tango and fox trot it was really quite cute and we were together 5 or 6 years and then a few years ago we broke up
and i felt pretty bad i have to say for a few years
i didn't feel much like seeing anybody, was eating donuts you know those crispy cream deals, it was bad and i was starting to look like homer simpson and i felt awful and i felt the pressure of you know my life moving on
and the millennium coming forward and i thought, you know what, it's time to do something different and find another girl.
aphrodite, the greek goddess of love inspired the word aphrodisiac.
aphrodisiacs are things said to arouse or intensify sexual desire or performance.
for schnitzy, it began with some advice from a friend.
i went up to my old college ithaca college, saw my old friend amy who i went to college with, long frizzy redhaired gal, burns candles, plays the dulcimer, just a whole different kind of person.
and she was already into these things aromatherapy and aphrodisiacs and she said "you'll feel better you can change your outlook you can change the way you physically feel, and physically perform and i said 'whoooa, ok and so amy really turned me on to the whole
aphrodisiac world.
cleopatra, it was said, drove mark antony out of his mind by mixing honey and almonds and applyingg the tantalizing paste to her most private parts.
casanova was reputed to eat dozens of oysters a day and it is said he once seduced a vestal virgin by sliding an oyster from his lips to hers.
the tradition of using libido enhancers may be over five thousand years old,
but is there any truth behind the folklore?
until the early 80's, most scientists had dismissed traditional aphrodisiacs as frauds.
but researchers are now finding that some do stimulate more than the imagination.
one popular substance that has been eaten, sniffed and smoked all because of its reputed aphrodisiac properties is the bark of yohimbe a west african tree.
and with the yohimbe you wanna take vitamin c 1000 milligrams to help in case you have a nauseous feeling.
it enhances the properties.
oh, ok, whatever properties i can enhance, the better.
they say on the box that it will take 8 hours to work.
eight hours?
so you have to brew it in the morning.
and how long does it last just so i git my timing down?
i bought some yohimbe in powdered form it's supposed to actually give you an erection for three days is what they say, uh you know i would have been happy with a couple of hours.
so i tried one form of it, a powdered form and basically
i just got sick you know i was nauseous for two hours.
yohimbe works in several different ways.
one of the ways is to increase circulation and the other way is to stimulate the nervous system.
it does however have some downsides in that it can stimulate heart rate, raise blood pressure and can make one feel a little anxious, nervous and even a little nauseous, so that, sometimes that may not be the most desirable effect
that you want to have in an aphrodisiac.
so despite its availability as a prescription drug,
yohimbine is not guaranteed to work and should only be used under the guidance of a physician.
many of the herbal aphrodisiacs including yohimbine work by increasing blood flow to the genitals.
when we're sexually stimulated by anythingphysically mentally or chemically the nervous system sends signals to the pelvic region the control center for the erection.
these signals prompt the blood vessels in the genitals to dilate, bringing in a rush of blood that inflates the erectile tissue.
the veins then close, preventing blood from flowing out of the organ.
the result is an erection.
one popular aphrodisiac is gingko.
it comes from the leaves and nuts of the oldest family of trees the gingko tree, and has been used in asia for centuries.
schnitzy decided to give it a try.
i drank this gingko tea, i'm not sure if it's a placebo effect or not but in my case i defimitely feel like gingko helped rush blood to critical parts of my anatomy which paid off with a fin air stewardess.
in the last 30 years, 300 studies have given clinical evidence that gingko can benefit the entire body in addition to having aphrodisiac qualities.
a german study of men with erectile dysfunction found that gingko restored potency in half of them.
but how does it work?
ginkgo may work by stimulating the brain to release nitric oxide in the erectile tissue of both men and women.
this causes the blood vessles to widen, more blood flows in and we have an erection.
but the jury is still out on how safe and effective gingko is.
it can have side effects such as headaches and shouldn't be taken with aspirin or by people suffering from heart disease.
hundreds of millions of dollars a year are spent in the pursuit of pleasure and the ingredients of love potions come from all parts of the world.
each culture finds its own aphrodisiacs, depending on what is locally available.
desert plants have been used as libido enhancers for centuries.
it is said that north american indian girls once combined ginseng with snake meat, gelatin and wild columbine then secretly added it to the meals of the young men they wanted as husbands.
one plant that has been used as an aphrodisiac in the southwest is damiana, a shrub native to north america.
chemical analysis shows that it contains substances similar to caffeine that can increase sensitivity in the genitals.
in asia, there are countless substances believed to have aphrodisiac properties.
many of these make their way across the globe.
there's folklore information that says that chinese goatherders noticed that their male goats were acting, in quotes, randy
randier than goats?
and it worked for the chinese shepherds?
well it worked for their goats i guess they started using it also.
well, you know what i always say joanne, what's good for chinese goats is good for me.
so with all these love aids available, is there any way to figure out which ones will guarantee sexual pleasure?
researchers have made some progress by ruling out some legendary substances that can do more harm than good.
spanish fly is perhaps one of the most well known so called love elixirs.
made from the dried bodies of beetles it works by severely irritating the urinary tract, sending a rush of blood to the genitals.
in asia, animal parts have been used for centuries.
the testicles of bulls and rams were once eaten in the hopes of becoming more verile.
and the phrase 'feeling horny' is said to come from the idea that animal head ornaments were considered aphrodisiacs.
powdered rhinoceros horns are still used in asia.
even though there is no proof that they work as an aphrodisiac.
although many traditional aphrodisiacs do not have the firm backing of science, some have enjoyed their positive effects.
but whether yohimbe or gingko can help your libido, may depend on whether you believe it will.
really, the cool thing about this aphrodisiac thing honest to god i'm not positive that it really works but you think it works and it has actually made a change for me.
after jamie i went for a couple of years and i was miserable then as i started eating oysters and drinking champagne and taking gingko
i started feeling better and i started meeting more women.
you know i don't know but recently i met this woman from spain, alehandra who was really quite great unfortunately she lives in spain you know so all the oysters in the world aren't going to help 6,000 miles of ocean, so um i'm still looking.
legend has it that seafood has been considered an aphrodisiac ever since the mythological aphrodite was born from the sea.
but some say there's more to 'sexy' foods than just folklore
hot, spicy, sweet, juicy, words that make you wonder if someone is describing a great meal or a great lover.
since the beginning of time food has been inextricably linked to our sexuality.
maria, she loves to eat, so i mean there is something i know
i can be always giving her especially a good, i would say dinner.
frank and maria met in a chicago mall two and a half years ago and the chemistry was instant.
maria works as a bookkeeper and frank drives a truck and for them, food is often the answer to keeping the flame alive.
he loves whipped cream and so do i, and strawberries and syrup, oh, yes.
so we try to make it interesting because you know sometimes if you just do the same thing all the time it just doesn't work.
but historically the lure of food as an aphrodisiac has had a lot more to it than the sharing of a romantic meal.
we have historical books that tell us about the use of foods for example in the kama sutra, they describe a meal of eggs and onions with cardamom cinnamon, and nutmeg.
if you have that before you meet your lover, your chances of having a better experience are greater.
before science began exploring how our bodies work, people followed a premise known as the law of similarities.
this dictated that what a food looked like determined how and where it could benefit the body.
legend has it that the aztecs in ancient mexico were so impressed with the anatomical likeness of the avocado that they named the food ahuacatl or testicle, and forbade village maidens to set one virginal toe outside while the fruit was being harvested.
many of the aphrodisiac foods were just thought to be aphrodisiacs because of their appearances like bananas asparagus, carrots because of their phallic appearance.
one of the most visually suggestive love foods is the oyster.
said by some to look like testicles when in the shell and by others to blatantly suggest a woman's anatomy,
but, some argue that you would have to eat dozens of oysters for them to jumpstart your libido.
not all of the fabled foods' powers have to do with their vitamin and mineral content.
when it comes to being a hotblooded lover, the chili pepper may hold the key.
the spicy substance in hot foods called capsaicin causes nerve endings to release substance p, a neurotransmitter that stimulates a burning sensation.
some believe that eating hot foods can also trigger the release of endorphins, body chemicals that give us a natural high.
and of course there is the ultimate lovers' gift chocolate.
used for centuries as an aphrodisiac part of its lure comes from its sensuous melting quality.
if you're talking about like sweets or something like that it would have to be like chocolate syrup.
you know because for one it's sweet, and it's, it's durable, you know i mean you can place it wherever you want you know, and then.
and you know the next place it's going is your mouth so it's like you get 1 and 2.
chocolate contains a substance called phenylethylamine which is a stimulant, it's considered the love chemical.
it gives one a sense of well being and excitement.
and that's thought to be a chemical it's very similar to the endorphins that our body produces that give us that natural high.
some scientist believe this chemical in chocolate is broken down before it can 'turn us on', but others say it may be one of the reasons why lovers will be buyingg up to 36 million boxes of chocolate in the united states
next valentine's day!
the writer dorothy parker has become legendary for sayingg,
"i wish i could drink like a lady.
i can take one or two at the most.
three i'm under the table.
four i'm under the host!"
aside from the fact that a bit of alcohol reduces our inhibitions, some studies have found that alcohol actually raises testosterone levels in women but not in men.
but drinkers beware.
too much alcohol, in both men and women, will put anyone's libido to sleep.
chicago classic rock station, cd94.7.
hi, this is dr. alan hirsch and we're looking for couples to volunteer for a test of kissing to see what odors and food tastes will enhance arousal.
just give us a call
okay, so what i want you to do is put your head back, stick your tongue out that's good.
and kiss.
maria and frank are 2 of the 500 neurologist, dr. alan hirsch has been testing.
over the last five years he's worked to measure the effect of taste and smell on arousal.
i had heard that dr. hirsch uses food to enhance the sexual pleasures and stuff and so i was interested in that aspect of it because i thought that maybe we could bring something new into, you know, the bedroom.
i want you to rate how much you liked the kiss, or disliked it.
how sexy you thought it was, how much you liked the way his kiss tasted, how much you desire to have another kiss from him.
we began to study using foods as aphrodisiacs because we found that when people lose their sense of smell or taste they develop sexual dysfunction.
so the connection became apparent.
almost 100 years ago, sigmund freud said that in order for us to remain a civilized society we had to repress our sense of smell, otherwise we would walk around sexually excited all the time.
dr. hirsch has been testing this theory for over 10 years.
up to 3,000 test subjects later he has found that certain food smells are so sexually exciting they actually increase penile and vaginal blood flow.
when we inhale an aroma odor molecules enter the nose and stimulate small hairs called cilia to send messages to the brain.
one part of the brain that receives these messages is the limbic system, often called the 'pleasure center'.
the signals then travel down to the spinal cord, and just like the food and herbal aphrodisiacs, cause blood to rush to the genitals.
the food smells dr. hirsch's studies found to have the greatest effect, aren't exactly foods we associate with a night of passion.
of all the food smells he tested he found that pumpkin pie was the way to a man's libido increasing penile blood flow by 40%, buttered popcorn came second increasing blood flow by 9%.
and the most arousing smell for women was the licorice candy
good plenty.
the curious thing hirsch's study found is that all smells actually arouse men to some degree.
women, who have a much more sensitive sense of smell, were more discerning.
what we found was some odors inhibited female sexual arousal, for example the smell of cherries had a negative effect, the smell of barbecue roasting meat and the smell of men's cologne all acted to inhibit female sexual arousal.
despite dr. hirsch's studies, smell remains the most mysterious of all our senses and we are still not quite sure why these food smells affect our libidos.
but for maria and frank, the flavor and aroma defimitely enhanced the sensation.
i forgot about the people in the room.
it was just me and him, you know.
i didn't feel like, like it was a study.
it was just and, it made you it made me feel a little bit you know, wanting him a little more, and then having to stop when they said stop.
i'm like, oh, okay.
we can't do anything else.
vitamins, minerals and a delicious aroma may enhance a night of passion, but the secret to the ultimate aphrodisiac may lie within the body itself.
the human body is forever surprising and delighting us
and aside from the obvious lures of beauty and seduction, the body itself has its own powerful aphrodisiacs.
these come primarily in the form of two body chemicals hormones and neurotransmitters.
some, neurotransmitters, like norepinephrine and dopamine are released primarily from the brain and send messages throughout our bodies.
they trigger our sensations of pleasure and arousal.
but when the body's natural love stimulants shut down, some people go in search of help.
mike albano, a 59yearold computer technician for the stock market, classifies himself as a "type a" personality.
he turned to chinese medicine after his highpressured work environment became too much to bear.
we live in a society today in new york city that's so fast paced, you have to make it today, you don't make it tomorrow.
it's what you do for me today that counts, not tomorrow.
so it's under a constant lot of pressure that you have to go through every day, and i was part of the rat race.
mike was suffering from stress a condition that affects 75% of americans.
i think if we look at the effects of stress on health and sexuality overall, stress is probably the most common cause of low libido.
mike's lack of libido and general ill health began to have an impact on his 30year marriage.
there was no communication, there was no closeness and stuff like that.
performance weighed heavily on my mind, because i knew deep inside that i wasn't doing what i was supposed to be doing for my wife and for my lover.
and the desire was weaning, it was practically disappearing.
when the body itself loses its own capacity to stir the libido, aphrodisiacs often become more of a necessity.
determined to get his body up and running again, mike decided to try acupuncture.
he put his trust in the hands of chinese herbalist and acupuncturist
adele reising.
oh good it looks so much better.
what i did for michael was i started him with weekly acupuncture treatments to increase his overall energy.
it's a question i commonly ask because it gives me information about the person, about their overall energy level and from a chinese perspective their source energy.
acupuncture is said to stimulate nerve paths, and some claim this causes the brain to release neurotransmitters which heighten desire.
others believe acupuncture may also help blood flow.
how you doing mike?
great, totally relaxed.
according to mike, weekly sessions of acupuncture and a combination of chinese herbs including ginseng have helped put him back on track.
from the very first session with adele, i brought a list of medications i was taking and she went through them all and she had told me that one of the specific medications
i was taking would have an adverse effect on my intimacy which i,
i totally was having.
and she said one of the benefits of acupuncture that it it flows with everything else and it would make everything come along better than what it was.
and it put the oomph back in to your life.
it put the oomph back, my oomph back with the oomph, oomph.
our relationship is now more intimate, more enjoyable.
and we're able to get out and do some things, take a walk when we want to.
we're back to where we once were.
the intimacy has improved to the point where has heightened
yes, has heightened.
and we have the oneness back again.
some of the body's most potent aphrodisiacs are our aromas not the obvious unpleasant smells like nervous sweat.
rather, each person has a unique smell print made up of pheromones.
pheromones are chemical substances released all over the body, but especially from the armpits, the genitals and under our hair.
we are surrounded by clouds of these molecules and leave trails of them as we walk.
some of these signals smell some don't.
it is believed that they are picked up by the noses of other people, who are either consciously or unconsciously attracted to our smell.
pheromones act in many ways for other animals as i guess what you'd call an aphrodisiac or at least as a sexual cue for an onset of sexual behavior.
they also do other things.
there are alarm pheromones, there are mating pheromones, of course there are courtship type pheromones, there are weaning or suckling pheromones, so they act in many sorts of ways.
whether or not a pheromone could act as an aphrodisiac in humans
i think is still a little bit of an open question.
in one double blind experiment young women were exposed to either pheromones or a placebo.
by the fourteenth week the number doubled!
and researchers say it wasn't just the power of suggestion, as the group exposed to the placebo experienced no change.
but, if pheromones are the source of chemistry between two people who are instantly attracted to each other without knowing why, the perfumes and scents humans can detect could also be considered powerful aphrodisiacs.
some believe that smell is the sense most closely linked to our sexuality.
aromas however, send signals directly to the limbic lobe provoking a more powerful emotional reaction.
but what happens when we combine the lure of scent with the supposed power of pheromones?
perfumes are now being used not only to enhance the fragrance of the wearer but since the early 90's, companies have cashed in on the idea that pheromones help sell products.
one success story is perceive, avon's new pheromone perfume.
out for only six months in 54 countries, this "mood enhancing" fragrance has become the number one selling perfume in avon's history.
this is one of my customer victoria's neighborhoods.
i typically come out here to deliver to her and then i might come through the neighborhood and see if i can't develop some more customers.
oh right, let's see what we have here today.
i brought you that perceive purse spray that you had ordered.
yes, i need to freshen this up a little, get my mood going a little
perceive's effect comes from synthetic pheromones said to be "moodenhancing".
these synthetic pheromones are meant to help relaxation reduce inhibitions and may enhance relationships with friends and lovers.
my relationship with my husband has even changed because i'm happier, i'm more selfconfident,
i feel sexier and he's liking that you know.
oh wait till you see what else i brought.
it's perceive for men.
you gotta be kidding.
nope, nope
does it have that same thing?
it has that pheromone thing happening, yup.
but some are skeptical about the effectiveness of pheromone perfumes
the pheromone molecule that they contain or the supposed pheromone molecule that they contain, really has i think has not been tested rigorously or rigorously enough to really know whether it has any activity.
and then of course there's the issue as to whether it'll really do what you want it to do.
after all if you splash a pheromone on and it truly is a pheromone then your expectation is of course it'll attract all the beautiful people in the world who will desire you and want you.
but in fact it'll attract anybody with a nose.
while research into the effectiveness of pheromones continues, there is one part of the body believed to be the center of it all.
i think our brain is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
so many things go into our sexual responsewhat we smell what we see, what we hear.
our brain is the main computer that will integrate and tell us what we're all feeling and these things will stimulate us sexually.
if our bodies themselves offer us the most powerful aphrodisiacs, from brain chemicals to natural scents, perhaps good overall health and fitness can help ensure sexual success.
in the last decade, health club membership in america has almost doubled.
but although tight abs and firm thighs may be pleasing to the eye, trying to attain a beautiful body might not be the only reason to have a good workout.
one california study polled 8000 women nationwide.
of those who did some type of aerobic activity regularly 40% were more easily aroused:
but is this simply because exercise brings increased selfconfidence or is exercise provoking any chemical reactions inside our bodies?
a vigorous workout can contribute to a release of betaendorphins also known as 'feel good opiates'.
endorphins are primarily found in the pituitary gland in the brain and are distributed throughout the nervous system.
hello, welcome to the show.
we're here to challenge you today with some new ways of thinking about your sexuality, about intimacy about love and life.
they counsel listeners whose love lives may need a little boost.
we have maggie on the line
hi greg, hi karen.
hi maggie, welcome to the show tell us why you're calling.
i'm 32, i'm married with two kids.
and both my husband and i are really busy, we have demanding jobs and we have demanding home lives and now it's not that the spark is gone, but it's defimitely waning.
10 years ago, greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a progressive, disabling illness that affects nerve cells in the brain and spine.
since i figured that ms was going to be timeconsuming and energy consuming,
greg and karen turned to exercise in their case, the eastern practice of tantra.
tantra for us becomes an exercise of both mind and body.
from the body standpoint, it helps us build the energy that we have, and it also helps us, release energy you know that goes into stress and it allows us to gain a relaxation and a joining then of each other.
we think of it as building energy through breath through postures like yoga postures and that this energy that we build is part of our expression of loving of payingg attention to one another of increasing the joy and vitality in our love.
there are two distinct ways to apply exercise to sexuality.
the western approach is to emphasize the physical by spending hours on the treadmill or lifting weights.
like some herbal aphrodisiacs tantra and yoga are said to help blood flow.
in yoga there are many exercises that because of the particular posture they will stimulate blood flow to certain organs.
and specific yoga exercises are geared towards improving the function of the ovaries the adrenal glands and the pituitary hypothalamus.
and it's the relationship of these organs together that helps our sexual function flow smoothly.
karen and greg practice tantra every week.
stretching is really one of the best exercises that i can do because it allows me to be flexible.
and even with your ms, you're actually more flexible than i am which annoys me, but the tantra exercises help us to build and keep sexual energy high.
for karen and greg, tantra proved to be the answer to their sexual dreams, but for others, dance is a great sexual enhancer.
indeed, dance often has the excitement, release and exhaustion characteristics of sexual climax.
dance is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
many of the latin dances for example are very sensual and very sexual.
many of the rituals involved in mating in various different civilizations involved dance.
vast strides in medical technology have helped to make the issue of sexual performance a 21st century obsession.
while our quest for the perfect aphrodisiac continues, have we replaced the potions of the past with the pharmaceuticals of the future?
has the art of love become the art of science?
in the united states it is estimated that over 58 million men and women may suffer from some form of sexual dysfunction.
the cause could be physical psychological or both but drug companies are competing to find a cure.
erection medication is so popular it is boasting over
$880 million dollars of sales and new treatments continue to hit the market.
there is a myth that these medications will enhance and create super sexual beings, and i think that that's something that's a risk as well because we don't want to become too intercourse focused as a society.
we don't want to become too goaloriented.
but to some, many of these drugs are nothing short of a miracle.
after greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, he suffered from erectile dysfunction and had to face the reality that medical assistance was needed.
his doctor prescribed caverject the first prescription medication approved by the fd a for erectile dysfunction.
caverject and penile injection therapy is not scary at all.
because i'm the one who used to pass out just at the mere thought of getting a shot, and this has never been a problem.
what's so neat about this is just how well it works and how quickly it works.
not that, you know, spontaneity tends to be overrated but it's nice not to have to wait an hour.
and we load it in here
and put this on
you ready?
oh yeah.
that banana has no feeling whatsoever.
and the medicine gets delivered and it's wonderful, viola.
for over 15 years, the pharmaceutical industry has targeted erectile dysfunction in men.
but now, the race is on to find the magic formula for women.
we used to think that male erection problems were primarily psychologically, or emotionally based, and now we've come to learn that in fact most male erection problems are physical or organic, meaning that there is a medical basis for them.
and we are just now, we're 20 years behind the men, but we are just now beginning to realize that as far as female sexual function, there are in fact a significant number of medical and physiologic processes that can affect sexuality in women.
a recent study conducted by the university of chicago found that over 40% of women in the united states may suffer from sexual dysfunction.
the result  drugs ranging from estrogen rings to blood flow creams that enhance genital sensation are being developed at a frenzied pace.
the best candidate for medication is a woman who was satisfied with her sexual response at one point in time, and now for whatever physical reason whether it be a pelvic surgery, or menopause or medication, is no longer able to respond as she once could.
this time of life has caused sexuality, the drive that is, to wane a little bit.
one could only imagine that women all over the world at my age are perhaps experiencing the same thing.
one could only imagine that even sophia loren must be you know going through this experience as well 55 year old petrina wells is not alone in her concern.
in fact, it is estimated that over 24 million women around the world reach menopause every year.
petrina, set off to canyon ranch spa in tucson, arizona to consult women's health expert dr. lana holstein.
i see so many women who have complaints like petrina's.
they come in stating that they really are troubled and frustrated by their lack of desire.
they want an active sexual relationship with their partner.
they're in a good space in life.
and yet they're really feeling a lack of this sense vitality when it comes to their sexuality.
do you feel like you're in menopause or mid life?
probably in the middle way through that.
ok, and are you on any hormones now?
i am, yes.
so are those like estrogen or progesterone?
has anyone talked to you about testosterone?
doctors have long been prescribing hormone replacement therapy for men suffering from impotence and women going through menopause, but today testosterone is the one that pharmaceutical companies are targeting as the next best libido prescription.
if you don't have any testosterone i think you do have trouble accessing your level of sexual interest or desire, so from my point of view, it is a very important aphrodisiac if you will.
in other words, it's a substance that we need to have in our body in order to access that want that desire.
in the ageold aphrodisiac quest modern medicine is finally offering some alternatives.
if you're talking about an aphrodisiac or an agent for lust it is testosterone.
and um, we're just in the very beginning, early phases of understanding the role of testosterone in women, but that is the hormone of desire in both men and women.
for petrina, the testosterone treatment may offer her the opportunity for many more years of passion with her partner rusty,
and she will need to followup with her doctor to monitor the effects of the medication.
but be it pharmeceuticals or age old aphrodisiacs, the goal remains the same.
i think its part of our human nature to keep searching for something better and as we discover more substances, we'll probably learn so much more about our physiology and be able to discover newer and greater things that will turn us on.
so while our quest for passion continues, most people seem to agree, that no plant, potion or pill alone can promise satisfaction.
perhaps the ultimate aphrodisiac is love itself.
all of this aphrodisiac stuff of course we're talking about lust you know, if you will, my goal and i think most people's goal is actually love, and to the degree that lust gets you to love
and then enhances love, hey you know
 i'm all for that.
so, if somebody feels that they want something, that aphrodisiac is probably going to heighten that sexual thing,
but for the moment i think.
but the thing is, if you got love love is gonna keep that memory all the time.
the ultimate aphrodisiac is love and being with mike.
you betchya.
